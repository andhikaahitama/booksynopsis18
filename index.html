<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The West Point History of the Civil War (1) (The West Point History of Warfare Series)</h2><p>The definitive military history of the Civil War, featuring the same exclusive images, tactical maps, and expert analysis commissioned by The United States Military Academy to teach the history of the art of war to West Point cadets.<br><br>The United States Military Academy at West Point is the gold standard for military history and the operational art of war. West Point has created military history texts for its cadets since 1836. For the first time in over forty years, the United States Military Academy has authorized a new military history series that will bear the name West Point. That text has been updated repeatedly, but now it has been completely rewritten and <i>The West Point History of the Civil War</i> is the first volume to result in a new series of military histories authorized by West Point.<br><br><i>The West Point History of the Civil War</i> combines the expertise of preeminent historians commissioned by West Point, hundreds of maps uniquely created by cartographers under West Point&#x2019;s direction, and hundreds of images, many created for this volume or selected from West Point archives. Offering careful analysis of the political context of military decisions, <i>The West Point History of the Civil War</i> is singularly brilliant at introducing the generals and officer corps of both Union and Confederacy, while explaining the tactics, decisions, and consequences of individual battles and the ebb and flow of the war. For two years it has been beta-tested, vetted, and polished by cadets, West Point faculty, and West Point graduates and the results are clear: This is the best military history of its kind available anywhere.</p><p>The United States Military Academy at West Point is a four-year federal service academy established in 1802 to educate and train students as future officers in the military. Since 1836, West Point has published and frequently updated for its cadets definitive military history texts, now including The West Point History of Warfare series, the most important and insightful overview of military history to date.The West Point History of the Civil War THE CIVIL WAR AT WEST POINT<p></p> <br>The Civil War was the most traumatic event in the United States Military Academy&#x2019;s history. During the 1850s, the Academy had changed from an institution that promoted nationalism to a bitterly divided school. In the early 1850s, James Ewell Brown &#x201c;J. E. B.&#x201d; Stuart praised the nationalizing effect of West Point, claiming that there was &#x201c;no North or South&#x201d; among the cadets. That soon changed, however. Peter Michie, who would later spend three decades teaching at West Point, arrived at the Military Academy as a cadet in 1859. He described how the corps of cadets split &#x201c;into two parties, hostile in sentiment and even divided in barracks.&#x201d;2 By November 1859, when abolitionist John Brown raided the arsenal at Harpers Ferry hoping to begin a massive slave uprising, the corps of cadets was no longer a unified body. Cadet Pierce Young from Georgia told several cadets, &#x201c;By God, I wish I had a sword as long as from here to Newburgh, and the Yankees were all in a row. I&#x2019;d like to cut off the head of every damn one of them.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Southern cadets became even more vocal before the 1860 presidential election, cowing cadets who supported Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s Republican ticket. Cadet George Custer reported that after the election in 1860, southern cadets burned the presidentelect in effigy as they looked to assail &#x201c;Republican Abolitionists in the Corps.&#x201d; One 1862 graduate who later fought at Gettysburg wrote that it took more courage to vote for Lincoln at West Point than it did to face Pickett&#x2019;s Charge.4<br> <br>West Point in 1860 was more violent and ill disciplined than at any other time in its history. Although few cadets were openly Republican, their number included Emory Upton, who would later become influential at the Academy and in the army. Upton was involved in one of the most famous brawls of that era, with Wade Hampton Gibbes from South Carolina. Gibbes resigned a few months later and fired one of the first shots of the Civil War at Fort Sumter. Gibbes accused Upton of &#x201c;intimate association with negroes&#x201d; while he was a student at Oberlin College, the first college in the country to admit African Americans. Upton was an avowed abolitionist, but nonetheless he found that assertion so offensive that he challenged the much larger Gibbes to a duel. Despite a deep cut on his face caused by a bayonet, the feisty Upton held his own during the brawl as southern cadets hurled abuse.5<br><br> <br>EMORY UPTON<br> <br>One of the few openly abolitionist cadets, Upton fought with Wade Hampton Gibbes on the eve of the Civil War. He later became one of the best tactical commanders of the Civil War and among the most influential officers of the postwar era.<br><br>Henry C. Farley of South Carolina was the first cadet to leave West Point following Lincoln&#x2019;s election, on November 19, 1860.6 By the summer of 1861, sixty-five of the eighty-six southern cadets had departed, often for high rank in the Confederate army.7 Louisiana-born and avowed secessionist Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard arrived at the Academy to assume duties as superintendent on January 23, 1861. He never decamped from the West Point Hotel; the new secretary of war, Joseph Holt, ordered the previous superintendent, Richard Delafield, to relieve Beauregard of his post after only five days. Holt rightly questioned Beauregard&#x2019;s loyalty and did not want him to assume the superintendency and then resign his commission, taking cadets with him.8 Among the faculty, no senior professor resigned. Dennis Hart Mahan, the longest-serving member, stayed at West Point despite his Virginia roots.9 Although only 23 of the 155 officers assigned to the West Point faculty from 1833 to 1861 joined the Confederacy, the resignation of high-profile officers such as former superintendent Robert E. Lee left the Academy open to criticism.10<br><br> <br>CADET REVIEW PARADE<br> <br>Prior to the mid-1850s, West Point had a nationalizing effect on the country. After 1855, cadets took control of the assignment process for the companies. Southerners went into two, and northerners went into the other two. Even on parade, the two sides began to separate.<br><br>While the internal trauma was terrible, the external attacks were even more dangerous to West Point. President Lincoln and Secretary of War Simon Cameron criticized West Point because so many of its graduates left the U.S. Army to fight for the Confederates. Radical Republican senators railed against the Academy and twice brought a vote to the floor of Congress to stop all funding to West Point and close the Military Academy. Senators argued that West Point was an incubator for secession and treason, and that it produced an aristocratic caste of officers to the detriment of volunteer citizen-soldiers. Senator Zachariah Chandler of Michigan declared that he &#x201c;was prepared to abolish West Point Academy. I believe that but for this institution the rebellion would never have broken out.&#x201d; Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio believed that a string of southern secretaries of war and Military Academy superintendents had so deeply molded the culture of the Academy that &#x201c;you can hardly find a graduate of West Point who is not heartily now the supporter of southern institutions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the whole batch were imbued with the southern secession doctrine.&#x201d; Not only did he denounce the &#x201c;perjured traitors&#x201d; who had resigned their commissions and gone to serve the Confederacy, he worried that hundreds of other graduates who had remained in Union blue were &#x201c;treacherous and rotten at the heart, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. doing us infinitely more mischief than any number of them who have turned and resigned their commissions.&#x201d; While most loyal officers thought such attacks were unfair, many did believe that the cadets and officers educated and nurtured at West Point who left for the Confederacy were traitors who brought shame to the Academy.</p><h2>Best Of The Word For Today</h2><p>For several years, readers throughout America and abroad have been blessed by the spiritual insights found in Bob Gass's quarterly devotional The Word for Today.<br><br>The Word for Today has proved to be so popular that we have had to print nearly a million quarterly booklets.

Her work includes over forty hours of produced scripts for successful sitcoms, one-hour dramas, TV pilots (both half hour and one hour), soaps, animation, documentaries, Movies of the Week, cable movies, and films.<p> 1. </p><p> Introduction </p><p> TV is where it's happening. It's where the money is, where the jobs are, where product is pumped out fast, and where writers have the privilege of seeing their material produced. This isn't necessarily so in films, where the process is very slow and the writer can be a one-hit wonder. </p><p> According to Writers Guild of America statistics, TV jobs outnumber film jobs by two to one. There are about four hundred movies made a year, and about three thousand television episodes. In television, if writers can find a way in, if they have the talent and know how to play it, they can go from a freelancer to a staff position, to story editor, to producer/creator, and even rise to the pinnacle of television, the showrunner. It happens; one of my former students even managed to pick up four Emmys along the way. And there are others who have achieved success. They have wonderful stories, some of which I will share with you. </p><p> I don't take credit for their success. It doesn't validate me as a teacher: they had what it takes. But their success validates what I believe in -- that achieving dreams does happen. </p><p> The business of television has changed since this book was first written, and I have changed as well. I continue to write, and I have sold movies to cable and television and sold two feature films. I'm currently attached to numerous projects, have a number of screenplays under option, and continue to teach. My screenwriting workshops have taken me to colleges and universities across the country, and farther. I've taught soap writing in Finland, where conflict is considered disrespectful (try that one!), and sitcom writing to the Chinese who don't speak a word of English (that one's even better!). My favorite workshops are the small private ones, where I work with writers in helping them develop their scripts. Getting to know my students and watching them grow as writers has made teaching a very satisfying part of my life. </p><p> Many of these writers are on their fifth and sixth screenplays. They get better with each script. If I see a project I think has market appeal, I will try with all my power to help them find access. </p><p> Two years ago I joined forces with another writer/producer, Joanne Storkan, and we formed the banner Honest Engine Films. I see the market from a different perspective now -- from both the buyer's and seller's point of view. I've become one of those people who too often says, "I'm sorry, we have to pass." I hate saying those words, because I know how the writer feels on the other end. But producing has given me many new insights, which I have shared with my students and will share with you throughout this book. </p><p> I make no false promises about this business. Let's face it: deciding to make a living by writing television scripts is not often a practical or easy career choice. </p><p> Television agent Mitch Stein, whom I interview later in the book, told me that when he speaks at conferences he likes to sit at the end of the dais, so when they finally get to him and ask his advice, he can tell everybody in the room, "Go buy a bus ticket and get out of town. Someday you will thank me for it." </p><p> Consider this: </p><blockquote> <i>The Writers Guild of America, West, and Writers Guild of America, East, together represent about 11,000 members, about half of whom work in a given year. According to Chuck Slocum, Assistant Executive Director who tracks all the numbers for both Guilds, out of the working half of the membership, the median income from writing over a five-year period is $62,000 per year.</i> </blockquote> <p> There are about 3,000 episodes of television written each year. Almost all of them are written by staff writers. On average a series has about a dozen writers. Now for the good news. </p><p> It can be done -- you <i>can</i> break into television writing. It happened to me; it's happened to some of my students. The industry is full of writers who somehow managed to buck the odds. Not all of these writers are related to somebody, nor did they all begin with contacts. Some of them lived outside the LA area. Their stories are as diverse as their personalities and the TV shows they write for. But the writers did all have one thing in common -- good ideas, well-written spec scripts, and some knowledge of marketing. The spec scripts were their calling card. They opened doors to an eventual sale. </p><p> The Story of Kevin Falls </p><p> I met Kevin in Los Altos, California, at Foothill College. It was one of my first college classes. He was a journalism major from Cal Poly. He had wonderful energy and enthusiasm and didn't miss a beat. I read his first screenplay; it was quite good, and I could tell that he had talent. The script didn't sell, but in the marketing process, Kevin found an agent. He kept writing. He completed his second screenplay -- it also didn't sell -- but he kept writing. One day I got a call from him. He was angry and distraught. He had three completed screenplays to his credit and still no bites. I completely understood his frustration, but I had a feeling he wouldn't give up. </p><p> About six months later I heard from him again. He called to tell me he had just signed a four-picture deal with Disney Studios. An executive there, a woman whom I came to know later, had read one of his scripts. She was not interested in buying the script, but she loved the way it was written. She called Kevin's agent and asked to read more. The agent sent down those two other scripts that had never sold. Again, for various reasons, she didn't buy the scripts, but she found the writing wonderful. It was not only consistent, but Kevin's style was perfect for the Disney genre. He was immediately placed under contract. </p><p> I saw Kevin a number of years later at a writer's conference in Hawaii where I was speaking with Kathie Fong Yoneda, a former executive at Disney Studios. </p><p> Kevin, at the time, had just signed on to write the <i>Pretty Woman</i> sequel, a project that later was shelved because of casting problems, and he, at the moment, was writing the movie <i>The Temp</i>. During the Q &amp; A, a young hopeful asked Kevin how many spec scripts he had written before he sold one. Kevin responded, "Seven." The kid's mouth dropped open. He asked what kept him going, and I'll never forget Kevin's answer. He said he was getting on the Bayshore freeway, and asked himself the same thing, <i>What if I never sell a screenplay?</i> And he got the answer. <i>It doesn't matter. I'll just leave them to my kids. I love it so much I'm going to keep on writing anyway. </i> </p><p> I kept track of Kevin's career because his name kept popping up on the television screen, and I saw him year after year picking up Emmys. </p><p> We met for a drink when I asked to interview him for my book. At the time his new show, <i>Journeyman</i>, was on the air. It was a great series, intelligently written, intricately woven, and filled with whopper surprises, but the timing was bad: the writers' strike was about to hit just as the show was gaining momentum, and <i>Journeyman</i>, along with some other good series, would become one of its casualties. </p><p> Kevin's enthusiasm hadn't waned. It was pretty clear he still loved what he did. I asked him when he had made the turn from features to television. He said he was a big sports fan, and when he heard HBO was doing <i>Arli$$</i>, a show about a sports agent, he looked into it and got on staff. He stayed with the show for three years, then wanted off. His agent convinced him to hang on for one more year and he'd get him a co-executive producer credit, and that would later help him get a better network job. A year passed, and the agent asked Kevin where he wanted to go. Kevin was a huge fan of <i>Sports Night</i>. When he heard they were looking for somebody, he got a knot in his stomach; he'd give anything just to be in the same room with those people. He met with the staff twice and didn't think it went well. But at the third meeting, Aaron Sorkin was there and asked Kevin if he could start that day -- at noon. He said it was the single most fulfilling moment of his career to be a co-executive producer with Aaron Sorkin on <i>Sports Night</i>! He continued working with Sorkin on <i>The West Wing</i>, where he served as co-executive producer for sixty-seven episodes that garnered four Emmys before going out on his own. Since then, he's been executive producer, creator, and showrunner for shows too numerous to mention. Go to imdb.com and type in his name if you'd like to see a list of his credits: it's two pages long. </p><p> My friend Pamela Wallace (Academy Award winner for <i>Witness</i>) believes that there's a defining moment in every character's life that subconsciously designs who they will become. I think that happens in our professional lives as well. For Kevin, I think it happened the day he was driving down the street and asked himself what he would do if he never sold a screenplay. He decided it didn't matter; he was going to keep writing anyway. I think that was the moment that defined Kevin Falls's success. <br> </p><p> There are two ways you can learn to write for television. One is to read television scripts, and the other is to write them. "How to" books are helpful, and I certainly hope you buy this one. But when you get right down to it, there is no text better than the actual script. For this reason, I have included in this book excerpts of scripts I have collaborated on or written in half-hour, one-hour, and two-hour movie formats. I use these examples to facilitate stepping you through the development process. They make it easier, because you have actual pages of action, narrative, and dialogue in front of you. </p><p> We will begin with the basic tenets of scriptwriting, then move on to the hooks that television rests on. We'll analyze these hooks so you'll know what producers are looking for in spec scripts. My goal is that you'll never watch the tube the same way again -- that every time you turn on your television set, you'll recognize what we've discussed, and your education will become much more than a one-time read. </p><p> ...</p></p><h2>Lancelot-Grail: 1. The History of the Holy Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation (Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation)</h2><p>AlthoughThe History of the Holy Grail opens the Vulgate Cycle, it was added after the events described in Lancelot and The Quest of the Holy Grail were already an established part of the Arthurian story. It is, in Hollywood terms, a `prequel&#39;, and relates the story of the Grail from its first appearance at the Crucifixion up to the point where it is placed by Alain, the Fisher King, in the castle of Corbenic, whose inhabitants then await the arrival of the chosen Grail knight. Many points in the narrative are designed to foreshadow or to explain the later adventures connected with the Grail, but it also draws on the stories in the apocryphal gospels and other legends of the crucifixion such as the story of Veronica, as well as unrelated material such as the story of Hippocrates. But it also provides many details about the Grail itself which are not found anywhere else. It is less chivalric in tone from the subsequent books of the Vulgate Cycle, and relatively few copies of the original survive. For a full description of the Vulgate Cycle see the blurb for the complete set.</p><p>Professor Norris J.

In celebration, we are publishing limited editions of twelve classic tales with colorful covers, special endpapers, and notes explaining the history behind each book. <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i> is the tale of a mischievous rabbit and his nerve-wracking encounter with Mr. McGregor.</p><p>The quintessential cautionary tale, <i>Peter Rabbit</i> warns naughty children about the grave consequences of misbehaving. When Mrs. Rabbit beseeches her four furry children not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, the impish Peter naturally takes this as an open invitation to create mischief. He quickly gets in over his head, when he is spotted by farmer McGregor himself. Any child with a spark of sass will find Peter's adventures remarkably familiar. And they'll see in Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail that bane of their existence: the "good" sibling who always does the right thing. One earns bread and milk and blackberries for supper, while the obstinate folly of the other warrants medicine and an early bedtime. <p> Beatrix Potter's animal stories have been a joy to generations of young readers. Her warm, playful illustrations in soft colors invite children into the world of words and flights of fancy. Once there, she gently and humorously guides readers along the path of righteousness, leaving just enough room for children to wonder if that incorrigible Peter will be back in McGregor's garden tomorrow. <i>(Ages Baby to Preschool)</i></p>Mr. McGregor has two things on his mind when he sees Peter in his garden. One is the safety of his lettuces; the other is rabbit pie. Peter was carefully told not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, but some little bunnies have to learn things the hard way. Beatrix Potter's classic story has been lovingly placed at the center of this creative effort, and David Jorgensen has given Peter and his family wonderfully droll and expressive character and charm in his illustrations. On the accompanying audiocaasette, Meryl Streep explores all of the drame, humor, and subtlety of the narrative, and none of its potential to entertain and teach has been left untapped. Musician/composer Lyle Mays has coordinated and augmented the work of both illustrator and narrator with a score that unifies and enlivens the whole enterprise. The combined artistry of the contributors results in a new and enriching experience that will be loved by all. <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i> was awarded a Grammy nomination for best recording for children in 1988.</p><h2>A Lucky Luke Adventure : Barbed Wire on the Prairie (Lucky Luke)</h2><p>Felps decides to plant lettuce on his property.

Khenchen Rinpoche wrote over thirty books in Tibetan and English."I am delighted with this translation of Mipham Rinpoche's&nbsp;<i>Sword of Wisdom</i>. Personally, this text has helped me so much in understanding the system of basic logic and reasoning that elucidates the profound meaning of the two truths.

He&#x2019;s gone underground to paint sewage-treatment plants and risked death to paint factory ceilings. He has no doubt inhaled enough noxious dust and paint fumes to shorten his life.</p> <p>But he&#x2019;s not dead yet. And the captivating characters he has encountered along the way have more than offset the toils of painting for a living. Ex-cons, addicts, drifting college grads, even a guy with a hole in his head&#x2014;that&#x2019;s your typical paint crew, bonded only by the fact that they&#x2019;re caught in a job society thinks is for simpletons. In <i>Watching Paint Dry,</i> John Burbidge scrapes beneath the surface of painting&#x2019;s reputation for monotony while intimately portraying the men and women who craft the backdrop to our civilization.</p> <p>"Informative, funny, and sometimes heartbreaking . . . this is a book you will want to recommend to everyone you know."</p> --Sharon Barrett, <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> book critic for 28 years</p><p>In addition to having painted professionally for fifteen years, John Burbidge is a writer whose award-winning stories have appeared in a variety of magazines, newspapers, and anthologies. He lives in Helena, Montana, with his wife and two daughters. Visit his website at www.howtopaintahouseright.com.From Big Sky Journal <br><br>This is the memoir of a professional painter (think houses, not canvas) from Montana who desperately wants to be something else. Or does he? Burbidge rolls out the long, sometimes painful, but always interesting journey he underwent for 15 years, and his eventual break with that fascinating subculture, all the while retaining his painter&#x2019;s soul. The book, as you might assume, is not really about painting. It&#x2019;s about the people who apply the paint. It&#x2019;s also about their lives, loves, hates, prejudices, addictions, and phobias. Burbidge describes them as &#x201c;Dressed in white as they craft a backdrop to civilization, painters invite invisibility, smarting from the stigma of a simpleton occupation.&#x201d; The author&#x2019;s masterful descriptions, dialogue and characterizations serve as an ideal base coat for these entertaining stories in which humor is often found even amid the soul-deadening weight of the daily grind. Burbidge hints at an undeniable pride in being a professional painter. And for good reason, as he says in his introduction: &#x201c;First fact about paint: it&#x2019;s only one-thousandth of an inch thick when dry. But that one-thousandth of an inch protects and colorizes most of what humans construct on this planet, so what it lacks in depth it recovers in width, despite going largely unnoticed except by the people who put it there. The painters.&#x201d; The next time I visit a supermarket or cross a bridge, I will try to remember that someone had to go up there, brush, roller, or sprayer in hand, and do the job that most of us take for granted. I&#x2019;ll think about what that person looks like, if he has kids, a college degree, a gambling addiction, a penchant for practical jokes, or a chip on her shoulder about how the public perceives her choice of occupation. And if you read this powerful and entertaining collection, I bet you will, too.</p><h2>Secrets of Bearhaven (Bearhaven #1) (1)</h2><p>It starts with a chase. When Spencer Plain is pulled out of school in the middle of the day, he never expects to be speeding down the highway with his uncle, trying to outpace the car that's tailing them. And he certainly never thought he'd find himself fleeing from a bear through the woods.<br>And when he hears the bear say "We've been expecting you," Spencer knows he's just uncovered a whole world he'd never imagined. He's brought to Bearhaven, a secret oasis his parents created for bears.<br>But there are depths to Bearhaven that Spencer and his new bear cub friend, Kate, start to uncover. Spencer finds out he's been there before, even if he can't remember. He also stumbles into a rescue mission being planned, to save a bear in danger. He knows he can help, and he's desperate to find clues to his parents' whereabouts, so he and Kate decide to take matters into their own hands - even if they discover a secret that could threaten Bearhaven's future!</p><p>K.E.

She creates, writes, and story develops for Egg in the Hole Productions, and lives in Brooklyn, New York. <br><br>Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;Fans of Erin Hunter's "Seekers" series (HarperCollins) and Hoot by Carl Hiaasen (Knopf, 2002) looking for a new series will enjoy this animal adventure novel. Spencer's parents are bear activists; they are constantly working to save the creatures from human-made and environmental danger. Spencer doesn't know how important the bears are until his father is kidnapped. To keep Spencer safe, his uncle takes him out of school and rushes him to a secret sanctuary in the woods called Bearhaven, a place complete with its own set of politics. The bears even have a special device that translates "bear speech" into English. Once Spencer arrives, a plan to rescue his father is formed. The action reaches an exciting climax with this daring rescue attempt, which, in conjunction with short chapters and the fast-paced plot, will have readers breathlessly turning pages. Although talking animal books are far from unusual, Rocha adds a unique spin to the genre in the creation of the fantastical Bearhaven. The ending sets up for a sequel. VERDICT A solid purchase for fans of animal adventure stories and eco-mysteries, this work will also appeal to reluctant readers.&#x2014;Patrick Tierney, Dr. Martin Luther King Elementary School, Providence, RI</p><h2>The Trouble with Cowboys (Wishing River, 1)</h2><p><p><i><b>&#x201c;A lovingly written modern-day fairy tale with complex characters and a well-earned, satisfying ending.&#x201d; - Kirkus Reviews</b></i><br><i><b></b></i><br><i><b>From </b></i><b>New York Times</b><i><b> bestseller Victoria James comes a poignant and heartfelt romance that wraps you in a warm embrace...</b></i></p><p>Eight years ago, Tyler Donnelly left Wishing River, Montana, after a terrible fight with his father and swore he&#x2019;d never return.

His progress in combating the virus was hindered by the politics of medicine and by a rival researcher determined to discredit his proposed solution. But Salk's perseverance made history-and for more than fifty years his vaccine has saved countless lives, bringing humanity close to eradicating polio throughout the world. <br><br><b>Splendid Solution</b> chronicles Dr. Salk's race against time-and a growing epidemic that reached 57,000 reported cases in the summer of 1952-to achieve an unparalleled medical breakthrough that made him a cultural hero and icon for a whole generation.</p><p>Jeffrey Klugeris a senior writer at <b>Time</b>. <b>Coauthor of Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13</b>, which was the basis for the movie Apollo 13, he is also the author of <b>Moon Hunters: NASA's Remarkable Expeditions to the Ends of the Solar System</b>.Jonas Salk decided early in his life that he wanted to make a significant mark in history. After discovering the joy of chemistry and the challenges of fundamental research, he settled on medicine. During WWII, he was the principal developer of the first effective flu vaccine. After the war, he turned his attention to polio, eventually developing the killed-virus vaccine that now has the world on the edge of eradicating the crippling virus. Jeffrey Kluger's story captures the drama and personal intrigues of scientific research, showing how jealousy and personal pique sometimes shape what happens and doesn't happen. Michael Prichard's clear, steady tone carries the reader, especially through detailed passages about research techniques and chemistry. At times, his voice sounds almost stentorian, but overall he does a good job, with no histrionics.

Most works of Japanese history fail to provide enough details about the lives of the people who lived during the time. The level of detail in <i>Everyday Life in Traditional Japan</i> allows for a more informed picture of the history of Japan. <br><br>In fascinating detail, Charles J. Dunn describes how each class lived: their food, clothing, and houses; their beliefs and their fears. At the same time, he takes account of certain important groups that fell outside the formal class structure, such as the courtiers in the emperor's palace at Kyoto, the Shinto and Buddhist priests, and the other extreme, the actors and the outcasts. He concludes with a lively account of everyday life in the capital city of Edo, the present&#x2013;day Tokyo.</p><p><b>Charles J. Dunn</b> was the Reader in Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. He lived and traveled extensively in Japan."This interesting little book is invaluable for anyone researching what life was like for people in Japan before the Meiji Restoration. While it's an essential volume for a writer of historical fiction, those interested in Japan more generally will find it readable and packed with interesting tidbits of information. For example, I would recommend it for those who study traditional Japanese martial arts (i.e. kobudo)to get a better insight into the art they study through knowing the society from which it sprang." &#x2014;<b><i>Goodreads</i></b></p><h2>Chosen to be God&#39;s Prophet: How God Works in and Through Those He Chooses (Biblical Legacy Series)</h2><p><p>God called Samuel to be his prophet during a time of crisis in Israel's history, a time when His chosen people had turned away from Him and were defiantly going their own way.

The first standard text on Blake and a cornerstone of the extensive scholarship on his life and work, it not only delivered its subject from unjust obscurity but also dispelled the notion of Blake's insanity and established his genius as a visionary artist and poet.<br>Sensitive, highly readable accounts trace Blake's childhood and years as an engraver's apprentice, his relations with patrons and employers, his trial for treason, and his declining health and untimely death. The author's wide-ranging research includes interviews with many of Blake's surviving friends, whose personal recollections add warmth and immediacy to this portrait. Extensive quotes from the subject's poetry and prose &#x2014; practically unknown at the time of the original 1863 publication &#x2014; further enliven the text. In addition to a critical commentary on Blake's boyhood poems, this transformative biography features more than 40 of his illustrations.</p><p>Of William Blake, William Wordsworth said, "There is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott." Blake was, after all, known to report on his "conversations" with such dead notables as the great Milton. He felt no constraint in sharing the bold content of his vivid imagination. "Once [he] was walking down Cheapside with a friend," Alexander Gilchrist writes. "Suddenly he took off his hat and bowed low. 'What did you do that for?' 'Oh! that was the Apostle Paul.'" This full-length study of the visionary artist and poet, first published in 1863, is credited with bringing to light not only the unique genius of William Blake, but his body of work.<p> When Gilchrist wrote this critical biography, the world was largely ignorant of William Blake (1757-1827). Most of his works--visual and poetic--were "never published at all ... [and] Blake's poems were ... not even printed in his life-time; simply engraved by his own laborious hand." The first-edition printing of <i>Songs of Innocence and Experience</i>, for example, consisted of slightly more than 20 copies. Nevertheless, Blake was not spared the ironic fate of so many posthumously honored artists. At the time of Gilchrist's writing, "Blake drawings, Blake prints fetch prices which would have solaced a life of penury, had their producer received them." </p><p> Of course, it's no surprise that <i>The Life of William Blake</i> is drenched in the style peculiar to the late 19th century, as if proclaimed in an echo chamber where lofty and pious tones vie with the sentimental. Still, who isn't drawn into the central tragedy of Blake's life? He had the capacity to become a great public and religious poet, but instead turned in upon himself, gaining neither reputation nor a following. Blake was simply not of his time, "partly by choice; partly from the necessities of imperfect education." </p><p> Although in paperback, this volume suggests antiquity--the type fonts are reminiscent of those used in the dusty, old tomes found in Grandma's attic. Chapter titles reflect the 19th-century sensibility ("A Boy's Poems," "Struggle and Sorrow," "Mad or Not Mad?"). The 39 chapters also reveal Gilchrist's exhaustive study of Blake's life. His report of Blake's first vision at the age of 8 reveals the 19th-century tone: "Sauntering along, the boy looks up and sees a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars." Unabridged and illustrated with 40 black-and-white photographs of Blake's engravings, this first critical biography will interest the Blake scholar wishing to add a more period feel to his or her body of research (100 years separate Gilchrist from his subject), as well as the Blake fan in the mood for a courtly and doting guide. <i>--Hollis Giammatteo</i></p>A seminal figure in both the literature and the visual arts of the Romantic age, William Blake (1757&#x2013;1827) dwelt his entire life in London, where he made his living as an engraver. The visionary poet and painter, whose art was misunderstood and overlooked during his lifetime, created intensely spiritual works informed by his strong philosophical and religious beliefs.</p><h2>Drawdown</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>The Official Punk Rock Book of Lists</h2><p><i>The Official Punk Rock Book of Lists</i> features over 200 of the funniest, craziest lists &#x2013; from the Most Offensive Songs to Stupidest Band Names, from Punk Sell-Outs to Fashion Don'ts &#x2013; culled from historical archives and generated by celebrity guests.

In this compelling book, seasoned theologian Michael Lodahl explores these fascinating divergences to discover the theological difference they make.<br><br>Writing from a Christian perspective that is respectful of the Islamic tradition, Lodahl offers an accessible introduction to Muslim theology and to the Qur'an's leading themes to help readers better understand Islam. Lodahl compares and contrasts how the Bible and the Qur'an depict and treat certain characters in common to both religions, including Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. He offers theological reflection on doctrines held in common by Christians and Muslims, such as creation, revelation, and the resurrection of the body. Lodahl also explores the Jewish tradition as an important source for understanding the Qur'an.</p><p>"Michael Lodahl reads the Qur'an alongside the Bible he professes and also the rabbinic commentary he admires. Through the pages of this lovingly crafted book, all Abrahamic believers are invited to feast together on God's word."--<b>Peter Ochs</b>, University of Virginia<br><br>"<i>Claiming Abraham</i> is a lively and succinct theological presentation of religious traditions from the point of view of their own exponents. Lodahl offers the reader the considerable assets of personal sensitivity along with a clear exposition of ideas and concepts. A work of acute reflection that combines integrity with charitableness."--<b>Lamin Sanneh</b>, Yale Divinity School; director, World Christianity Initiative at Yale<br><br>"In a novel approach to interreligious dialogue, Lodahl puts the Bible and the Qur'an in conversation with one another. The result is a fascinating study that shows how the two scriptures often draw upon and reshape the same pool of traditions. A fine guide for those interested in exploring the shared scriptural heritage of Jews, Christians, and Muslims and its implications for the future."--<b>John Kaltner</b>, Rhodes College<br><br>"<i>Claiming Abraham</i> offers readers an introduction to the relationship between the Bible and the Qur'an that is both easy to understand and rich in detail. Most impressively, Lodahl avoids clich�s and superficial assumptions by illustrating how these religious traditions are more often in disagreement than in agreement over figures such as Adam, Abraham, and Jesus. Ultimately, Lodahl presents an account of these matters that is marked by candor, clarity, and a firm grounding in Christian theology."--<b>Gabriel Said Reynolds</b>, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"Scholars will find this book brimming with comparative/interreligious and exegetical/intertextual insights. For all other readers, including those wondering if it is possible to acknowledge the revelatory status of the Qur'an while remaining committed to faith in Christ, <i>Claiming Abraham</i> accessibly engages the theological matters at stake in ways that, if taken seriously, will both deeply inform Christian faith in a pluralistic world and transform the next generation of Christian-Muslim relations."--<b>Amos Yong</b>, Regent University School of Divinity<br><br>"<i>Claiming Abraham</i> has recourse to a fine repertoire of skills in reading scripture and in theological interpretation, to lead us on a journey of discovery of the similarity-in-difference that characterizes the ways Christianity and Islam can be seen to relate to one another. 'Similarity-in-difference' is the key, for each will prove illuminating in understanding the other. . . . Our conversation does indeed go on . . . and the better so in the wake of careful comparative studies like this one."--<b>David Burrell, CSC</b>, Uganda Martyrs University<b>Michael Lodahl</b> (PhD, Emory University) is professor of theology at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego, California, and has studied extensively in Israel and Jordan.

H. Almaas presents the highest level and most profound teachings of the Diamond Approach on the true nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.</b><br><br> The teaching in this book is off the map&#x2014;because reality itself cannot be captured in a map. In fact, reality is far more alive, far more mysterious than anything we can conceive of. &nbsp;It is always revealing itself by knowing itself; and knowing reality and living it becomes the fulfillment of our life. A. H. Almaas, the originator of the Diamond Approach, here presents a new paradigm for understanding reality: the view of totality. He reveals that our life can become an endless revelation of reality, an adventure with neither beginning nor end.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>A. H. Almaas has been developing and teaching the Diamond Approach, a spiritual path of self-realization and maturity based on an original synthesis of modern discoveries in the field of psychology and a new paradigm about spiritual nature, for more than thirty years. If we can say the Diamond Approach has a goal it is to realize the truth at progressively deeper levels until one reaches the ultimate Truth, the Absolute, and to become integrated into that truth so that we are a living presence and embodiment of that truth. The teachings of this path have been unfolding over time, and <i>Runaway Realization</i> presents&#x2014;for the first time in print&#x2014;the highest level of teachings in the Diamond Approach in the most profound work by Almaas so far. In this book, Almaas offers a detailed look at the true nature of reality and the nature of enlightenment. He also talks about practice--what it is and what it isn't, and how practice relates to the process of realization. He looks at what it is to be a human being and what our role is in the totality of the universe. The material includes a discussion of the nature of space and time, as well as a view of more and more subtle levels of realization.</p><p>A. H. ALMAAS is the pen name of Hameed Ali, the Kuwaiti-born originator of the Diamond Approach, who has been guiding individuals and groups in Colorado, California, and Europe since 1976. He is the author of many books, including <i>The Power of Divine Eros</i> and <i>The Unfolding Now</i>.&#x201c;Beyond duality and nonduality, the realizations voiced here are like the immediacy and laughter of Zen, expressions of untethered freedom beyond fixed view, the joy of letting go, embracing paradox, liberating wisdom, a gift of grace.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jack Kornfield, author of <i>A Path with Heart</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s exhilarating to see a master teacher break free and clear&#x2014;even of his own teaching!

While young gay men often come out more readily, even those from the most progressive of backgrounds still struggle with the legacy of early-life stigma and a deficit of self-acceptance, which can fuel doubt, regret, and, at worst, self-loathing. And this is to say nothing of the ongoing trauma wrought by AIDS, which is all too often relegated to history. Drawing on his work as a clinical psychologist during and in the aftermath of the epidemic, Walt Odets reflects on what it means to survive and figure out a way to live in a new, uncompromising future, both for the men who endured the upheaval of those years and for the younger men who have come of age since then, at a time when an HIV epidemic is still ravaging the gay community, especially among the most marginalized.</p><p>Through moving stories&#x2015;of friends and patients, and his own&#x2015;Odets considers how experiences early in life launch men on trajectories aimed at futures that are not authentically theirs. He writes to help reconstruct how we think about gay life by considering everything from the misleading idea of &#x201c;the homosexual,&#x201d; to the diversity and richness of gay relationships, to the historical role of stigma and shame and the significance of youth and of aging. Crawling out from under the trauma of destructive early-life experience and the two epidemics, and into a century of shifting social values, provides an opportunity to explore possibilities rather than live with limitations imposed by others. Though it is drawn from decades of private practice, activism, and life in the gay community, Odets&#x2019;s work achieves remarkable universality. At its core,<i> Out of the Shadows</i> is driven by his belief that it is time that we act based on who we are and not who others are or who they would want us to be. We&#x2015;particularly the young&#x2015;must construct our own paths through life. <i>Out of the Shadows</i> is a necessary, impassioned argument for how and why we must all take hold of our futures.</p></p><p>"<i>Out of the Shadows </i>is the story of what it is to be gay and alive now. Walt<br>Odets's profound sensitivities to the dimensions of the closet, the plague<br>years,survival, and rebirth have resulted in a monumental and mature<br>painting--a giant mural of where we have been and where we stand. There<br>is loss and humanness, and there is hope in the despair he charts. There is<br>communion and commonality, and ultimately, there is celebration of how<br>outsiders insist on being known and seen. All the stories--from those closest<br>to Odets to those at a slight clinical remove--form a quilt that drapes<br>over a culture that is still learning what comes next after the worst has happened.<br>I wept with sorrow and pride at the persistent and contradictory life<br>force running in a seam throughout the book. <i>Out of the Shadows </i>is a major<br>addition to the literature of gay life and death, of the difficult task of finding<br>forms of intimacy that humans need in order to thrive."<br><i>--Jon Robin Baitz,playwright</i><i></i><i></i> <i></i>"<i>Out of the Shadows</i>&nbsp;is a beautifulbook, perfectly and artfully balanced between acknowledging the trauma ofHIV/AIDS and envisioning a future rich with possibility and joy. Walt Odetsdoes what few other writers have done before. Drawing deeply from thediversities of gay male culture, the lives of his clients, and his ownexperience, he skillfully and lovingly explores the emotional and psychicrealities of being a gay man today. Compelling, compassionate, and at timeseven humorous, this is an important book that addresses, with greatseriousness, both the demands of intimacy and powers of sexuality." --MichaelBronski, professor, Harvard University, and author of&nbsp;<i>A Queer Historyof the United States&nbsp;</i><b>Walt Odets</b> is a clinical psychologist and writer.

He looks at the theological origins of political Islam and takes us through the rise of militant Islam in Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, examining the impact of radical Wahhabi proselytizing, and Saudi oil money, on the rest of the Islamic world. <br><br><b>The Crisis of Islam</b> ranges widely through thirteen centuries of history, but in particular it charts the key events of the twentieth century leading up to the violent confrontations of today: the creation of the state of Israel, the Cold War, the Iranian Revolution, the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan, the Gulf War, and the September 11th attacks on the United States.<br><br>While hostility toward the West has a long and varied history in the lands of Islam, its current concentration on America is new. So too is the cult of the suicide bomber. Brilliantly disentangling the crosscurrents of Middle Eastern history from the rhetoric of its manipulators, Bernard Lewis helps us understand the reasons for the increasingly dogmatic rejection of modernity by many in the Muslim world in favor of a return to a sacred past. Based on his George Polk Award&#x2013;winning article for <i>The New Yorker</i>, <b>The Crisis of Islam </b>is essential reading for anyone who wants to know what Usama bin Ladin represents and why his murderous message resonates so widely in the Islamic world.</p><p>After the terrorist attacks of September 11, many Americans yearned to understand why Muslim extremists felt such passionate animosity toward the Western world, particularly the United States. Since that historic attack there have been many books and discussions about this very question, but few of them offer such a readable and relevant response as this excellent offering by renowned historian Bernard Lewis (<i>What Went Wrong?</i>). For modern Westerners, Islam is an especially foreign religion and culture to understand. For instance, Westerners typically dismiss things as unimportant when using the expression "that&#x2019;s history." But for those raised in Muslim households, history&#x2014;even ancient history&#x2014;is just as important (if not more important) as the present. And to better understand the hostilities rooted in this history&#x2014;one could start with recognizing the long-standing resentment the Islamic community harbors from having its homelands torn apart and re-packaged into random political states by occupying Europeans (Westerners). Or stretch back in time to the brutality of the Crusades. Or go straight to the U.S. political meddling in the region throughout the latter 20th century. <p></p> This is not a pity fest for Muslims. Lewis even-handedly explores the sources of Islamic antagonism toward the West while also explaining how a supposedly peace-worshipping religion could be so distorted by violent extremism. He notes that the American way of life&#x2014;especially that of fulfillment through material gain and sexual freedom&#x2014;is a direct threat to Islamic values (which is why night clubs&#x2014;places where men and women publicly touch one another&#x2014;are targets of bombings). But it is basic Western democracy that especially threatens Islamic extremists, notes Lewis, because within its own community more and more Muslims are coming to value the freedom that political democracy allows. For anyone wanting an intelligent and accessible primer on the Islamic-Western conflict, this is an excellent place to begin. <i>Gail Hudson</i>&#x201c;Terrorism requires only a few. Obviously the West must defend itself by whatever means will be effective. But in devising means to fight the terrorists, it would surely be useful to understand the forces that drive them.&#x201d; &#x2014;from the Introduction<br><br>&#x201c;Remarkably succinct . . .

She became psychic in mid-life after years of intensive study and training, and is now a believer that everyone has the potential to tap into their intuition and understand the world at a deeper level.<br><br><i>Psychic Intuition</i> bridges the gap between skeptics who can analyze but don't experience psychic phenomena, and believers who have the experiences but lack the ability to analyze. This book explains, for the first time, how psychic ability works in the brain.</p><p>Nancy du Tertre is an attorney who became a trained psychic detective, spiritual medium, medical intuitive, and paranormal investigator. A magna cum laude graduate of Princeton University, she is a frequent media guest. Du Tertre also lectures to university<br>psychology students and paranormal conventions and hosts her own radio show--Hot Leads Cold Cases--on Para-X and CBS Radio. Her Website is theskepticalpsychic.com."<i>Psychic Intuition</i> gives the most compelling explanation of why humans have the ability to read each other's minds and see the future. This groundbreaking book will help skeptics and believers alike begin to understand this field that historically has been shrouded in taboo, mystery, and distrust."<br>--Uri Geller, world famous mentalist<br><br>"<i>Psychic Intuition</i> is a real find. Whether you believe in psychic phenomena or not really doesn't matter. Nancy du Tertre clearly makes it obvious that the phenomena and the ability to function with intuitive skills are rampant throughout our culture."<br>--The Amazing Kreskin<br><br>"This is a breakthrough book--and timely so, because the cutting-edges of quantum physics and advancing brain wave research are finding themselves increasingly entangled with serious implications that paranormal stuff probably does exist and is probably innately and normally interactive with the fundamental essences of all life forms. <i>Psychic Intuition</i> is well-researched, the information well-organized, and the text is extremely readable, while some of the situations she describes might inspire a chuckle or two."<br>--Ingo Swann, creator of the CIA remote viewing/psychic spy program<br><br>"In my dual roles as economist/businessman and student of indigenous practices, I've found that hard-nosed corporate executives often practice something akin to shamanism. They don't refer to their abilities as "psychic," but rather describe themselves as being "good judges of human nature," having "a feel for the market," or "flying without radar" -- as though psychic skills are forbidden genies that must be hidden in the proverbial closet. Psychic Intuition opens the door to that closet. Nancy du Tertre backs up her ideas with well-researched answers to age-old questions and inspires us all to go deeper into this amazing subject."<br>--John Perkins, New York Times best-selling author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman<br><br>"Psychic Intuition is clearly the result of a tremendous amount of work by the author researching the topics she covers. It is intelligent and thoughtful and altogether a most impressive effort."<br>--Jim B.

Victor Terras&#x2019;s companion work provides readers with a richer understanding of the Dostoevsky novel as the expression of a philosophy and a work of art.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his introduction, Terras outlines the genesis, main ideas, and structural peculiarities of the novel as well as Dostoevsky&#x2019;s political, philosophical, and aesthetic stance. The detailed commentary takes the reader through the novel, clarifying aspects of Russian life, the novel&#x2019;s sociopolitical background, and a number of polemic issues. Terras identifies and explains hundreds of literary and biblical quotations and allusions. He discusses symbols, recurrent images, and structural stylistic patterns, including those lost in English translation.</p><p>Victor Terras is the Henry L. Goddard University Professor of Slavic Languages and Comparative Literature emeritus at Brown University. His many books include <i>Reading Dostoevsky</i>, also published by the University of Wisconsin Press; <i>The Idiot: An Interpretation</i>; and <i>A History of Russian Literature</i>, as well as translations of Dostoevsky's works."Few American scholars are as qualified to write about Dostoevsky and nineteenth-century Russian literature as Victor Terras."&#x2014;David Matual, <i>International Fiction Review</i></p><h2>Chinua Achebe: Collected Poems</h2><p><b>"The father of African literature in the English language and undoubtedly one of the most important writers of the second half of the twentieth century." --Caryl Phillips, <i>The Observer<br><br></i></b>Chinua Achebe's award-winning poems are marked by a subtle richness and the political acuity and moral vision that are a signature of all of his work.&nbsp;Focused and powerful, and suffused with wisdom and compassion, <i>Collected Poems </i>is further evidence of this great writer's sublime gifts and it is an essential part of the oeuvre of a giant of world literature.</p><p><b>Chinua Achebe&nbsp;</b>(1930&#x2013;2013)<b>&nbsp;</b>was born in Nigeria. Widely considered to be the father of modern African literature, he is best known for his masterful African Trilogy, consisting of&nbsp;<i>Things Fall Apart, Arrow of God</i>, and&nbsp;<i>No Longer at Ease</i>.

When the five children befriend him they find that each wish granted often has a sting in its tail. Golden guineas are too difficult to spend, wings let them down in a most inconvenient way, and when they wish for Red Indians, the children forget that they can sometimes be a little warlike.</p><p>The five children find a cantankerous sand fairy or &#39;psammead&#39; in a gravel pit. Every day &#39;It&#39; will grant each of them a wish that lasts until sunset, often with disastrous consequences. Five Children and It was first published in 1902, and it has remained in print ever since. The Introduction to this edition examines Nesbit&#39;s life and her reading, showing how she was poised between the Victorian world and a new era in which children in literature were no longer mere projections of the adult viewpoint. Sandra Kemp examines how the narrative is structured around the acting out of literary fantasies, which always come down to earth. Nesbit combines wonderfully implausible events with the prosaic and familiar, and Kemp illuminates her exploration of the shifting relationship between imagination, literature, and life.<p>Edith Nesbit Bland (1858-1924) published most of her work under the signature of E. Nesbit and wrote or collaborated on more than sixty books for children. Her works include <i>The Railway Children, The Story of the Treasure Seekers,</i> and <i>The Wouldbegoods</i>.</p></p><h2>Stay Interesting: I Don&#39;t Always Tell Stories About My Life, but When I Do They&#39;re True and Amazing</h2><p><b>What makes a life truly interesting? Is it the people you meet? The risks you take? The adventures you remember?<br><br></b>Jonathan Goldsmith has many answers to that question. For years he was a struggling actor in New York and Los Angeles, with experiences&nbsp;that included competing for roles with Dustin Hoffman, getting shot by John Wayne, drinking with Tennessee Williams, and sailing the high seas with Fernando Lamas, never mind romancing many lovely ladies along the way.<br><br>However, it wasn&#x2019;t all fun and games for Jonathan. Frustrated with his career, he left Hollywood for other adventures in business and life. But then, a fascinating opportunity came his way&#x2014;a chance to star in a new campaign for Dos Equis beer. A role he was sure he wasn&#x2019;t right for, but he gave it a shot all the same. Which led to the role that would bring him the success that had so long eluded him&#x2014;that of &#x201c;The Most Interesting Man in the World.&#x201d;<br><br>A memoir told through a series of adventures and the lessons he&#x2019;s learned and wants to pass on, <i>Stay Interesting</i> is a truly daring and bold tale, and a manifesto about taking chances, not giving up, making courageous choices, and living a truly adventurous, and always interesting life.</p><p><b>Jonathan Goldsmith</b> grew up in the Bronx, trained in theater in New York City, then moved to Los Angeles.

Mother did. I was only six weeks old, just a newborn swaddled in cloth. The supermarket was just at the bottom of the hill, only a few blocks from our apartment in Riverdale. I'll never know what happened next. I do know that Mother left the store, taking her groceries home, but she left one package behind.<br><br> Mind you, she was busy. And adored. She had started working for Conover's Cover Girls, a leading model agency run by Harry Conover, then the fashion czar of New York. The job was the gateway to fame, stardom, and fortune. She modeled sable pelts, feather boas, silk brassieres, hats, bathing suits. She was close friends with Lauren Bacall, who also started her career as one of Harry Conover's Cover Girls, and always ran late to auditions. Maybe that was why, in the bustle of juggling grocery parcels and a budding career, something had to get overlooked and left behind in the aisle of a supermarket.<br><br> Unfortunately, that something was an infant. And, most unfortunately, that infant was me.<br><br> When I asked her about it years later, at least her answer was honest.<br><br> "I just forgot," she said. But I never did.<br><br> It would not be the last time she left me someplace. When I was five years old, perhaps the earliest age a parent can legally send a child away, I was enrolled in Mrs. Hunt's Boarding School, a depository for errant children, in Cedarhurst, Long Island. My memories? Pulling up to the brick building in a taxi, dressed in a suit and tie, the late spring snow dusting over the windshield in flakes that quickly disappeared.<br><br> Mrs. Hunt was the headmistress, and she scared me. Even at that age I could recognize an attractive woman, but her blue eyes were cold, austere, and judgmental. My mother and I sat across from her at her desk, my legs dangling from the seat. Mrs. Hunt listened as Mother told her how I had become a difficult child at home.<br><br> The problem was, I was listening too. Apparently, I was a naughty, unloving, unmanageable boy. This was news to me. I wanted to speak up. She's lying! But, being five, I was not adept at personal representation. So I just sat there, and soon I was watching the taillights of her taxi disappear through the windows. I chased after her, and when I knew she was not coming back and I could not catch her, I hid under the yellow flowers of a forsythia bush, already in bloom in spite of the late snowfall. As I had yet to learn the finer intricacies of covert operations, I was soon discovered, picked up under the arms by Mrs. Hunt, and ferried through the dorm, which for some reason smelled like burned toast, and into a quaint room. I watched the heavy door close behind me.<br><br> The truth was, I wasn't a bad kid. I just missed my father. And imagining him coming to rescue me, wearing the maroon Woolrich coat he always did when we went fishing, the hood hanging back over his shoulders, got me through my days. When was he coming to get me?<br><br> At night, I cried myself to sleep at Mrs. Hunt's, staring at the ceiling. My mother was wrong about me, and I knew it. If I had known more about her past or had the ability to understand that she was doing her best, it would have been different. But I was a five-year-old; my emotional maturity and deep sense of empathy were less than developed.<br><br> Your Body Can Do Anything You Put Your Mind To<br><br> The truth is, Mother was not suited for parenthood, a predilection that was not her fault. Her own mother had died in front of her, suffering a stroke in a shop the family ran in Brooklyn. Her untimely death left my mother, Greta, and her older brother, Eli, to fend for themselves. They had their father, my grandfather Alexander, but he was a radical eccentric, an intellectual, and a drifter. And after my grandmother's death, drift he did.<br><br> Alexander was disabled, so it's amazing he drifted so far, landing on that pirate boat off Costa Rica and living for a time on a Navajo reservation. As a young child he developed a bone disease, osteomyelitis, and his legs never grew. His disease was difficult to treat professionally. So he treated it himself, most unprofessionally: On his shin, there was deep open wound that revealed his faulty bones. He'd take out his pocketknife, flip open the blade, and start carving away at his shin bone, eliciting a terrible odor that reminded me of rotten meat. I don't know why cutting up his own leg caused such a foul smell or why it was therapeutic, but I do know it happened. I assure you. I saw it.<br><br> As odd as he was, Alexander was an inspiration. To compensate for his failing legs, he followed an intense muscle-building regimen for his upper torso, which came to resemble that of a Greek god. He was so strong he could perform an iron cross, a gymnast's maneuver in which he suspended himself between two steel rings with his arms held horizontally. And yet he couldn't even walk on his own. To steady himself, my grandfather used a shillelagh, a cane made from dark hardwood, which doubled as a cudgel to threaten anyone who disagreed with his Bolshevik politics, which was just about everyone.<br><br> He was hardly a nurturing soul. Once, I remember Flight, our springer spaniel, jumped up on the nightstand and ate my grandfather's dentures, then washed them down with a delicious black slipper. Grandpa was pissed. Shillelagh in one hand raised for battle and the surviving slipper in the other, he hobbled spastically after the frightened dog, frantically whipping the air with the footwear.<br><br> "I'll kill that fucking mutt," he said, expectorating brown spittle from the Ivanhoe tobacco curled up in his lip. In his frenetic effort to attack the dog, he lost his balance. But the poor dog lost much more. Terrified, Flight sprinted toward the second-floor window and, true to his name, jumped out. (The dog survived his fall, but he ended up with a limp, just like Grandpa.)<br><br> Grandpa was caustic and unpredictable, but he was a dreamer, and his mind swirled with energy and fantastic ideas. He was an amateur mason and liked working with stone, and one of his many cockeyed ideas was to invent a doghouse made from concrete. If he could prefab the design (God knows how), he calculated a massive fortune would follow. Not surprisingly, the cement doghouse never made it to market, but his own personal adventure stories were so riveting, they would inspire my own wayward travels. I remember him describing the way he converted his Model A Ford into a camper, retrofitting the back into his own sleeping quarters in which he caravaned across the country. I can almost see him stopping at those Navajo reservations, regaling the Native American chiefs there with tales of&nbsp; his travels and teaching them herbal remedies found in nature, or, more likely, the Yiddish theater. During the Great Depression he'd arrived in Los Angeles and, with his knowledge about the body and his own natural strength, helped found Muscle Beach. Then he was off to Central America. I never learned how he found work as a cook on a pirate ship, but he did tell me they smuggled mahogany out of Costa Rica. His was a wild life, but as he explored the world, Mother and Eli were left at home to fend for each other.<br><br> There Are All Different Kinds of Heroes<br><br> Before he disappeared to trek around the world in search of adventure, Alexander left the custody of my mother and her brother, Eli, to a handful of relatives, who shuffled them between their homes like playing cards. The pride of the family was Eli, who first lived in Jackson Heights with Uncle Louis. Uncle Louis worked part-time as a masseuse in the Catskill resorts, never went anywhere without a cigar in his mouth, shot craps in his basement, and possessed the family gene that made him sharply critical of everyone except himself. A cast of cantankerous characters-Cousin Paul, Uncle Max, Cousin Herbie, and Monroe, each a bit eccentric in his own special way-also helped raise my mother and Eli for a while. Not having a family or place of their own left its mark. Eli and my mother rarely had their own clothes as children, always the recipients of hand-me-downs from the cousins and other family members. My mother dreamed of a better life-or at least clothes that were her own-for herself and Eli.<br><br> Soon, she would dream only for herself.<br><br> My uncle Eli graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, and, since the war had begun, he was promptly shipped out to one of the farthest outposts: the South Pacific theater.<br><br> With her mother gone and her absentee father wandering the country in his camper, my mother's closest family member was Eli. He raised her as best he could. Back in New York, along with her relatives, she eagerly read his letters from the front. Shortly after the letters stopped, the military car arrived with the navy's regrets from Washington. There had been an attack. He had been on a destroyer, working as a lieutenant. It was a dangerous assignment, considering Japanese destroyers owned those waters. Inevitably, a kamikaze pilot had attacked them.<br><br> Inside their boat, the sailors were rocked, scrambling to put out fires and keep the oncoming water from sinking the ship. Eli was down in the hull, pushing through the chambers, trying to close the large doors to keep more water from coming onboard. The water kept rising, though. He came to a door and started to close it, but there was no way to close it and get to safety behind it. As the water filled up the chamber around him, he grabbed the wheel and started turning it to lock the door tight, ensuring that the others might have a chance to live and guaranteeing that he would not.<br><br> Many years later, long after the war, Mother traveled to the South Pacific to visit the grave marker with his name on it, which had been placed in New Caledonia. She must have wondered why the forces of nature had colluded so heavily against her, first making her father disabled, then taking her mother before her own eyes, and finally leaving her hero brother dead in foreign waters. Without Eli, my mother's only protector was gone.<br><br> It's one thing to understand the magnitude of these losses, one after another, intellectually. It's quite another to understand them emotionally. It took me some years to comprehend it all. About fifty, if we're being honest. But, many, many years later, on a dock overlooking a lake in Arizona, my mother and I would talk, deeply, honestly, sincerely. She would apologize. And I would forgive her. I came to understand that her circumstances cornered her and drove her to selfishness. With everyone gone, she'd had to fend for herself, she must have thought. And maybe that's why she occasionally left me. And why she left my father.<br><br> He was a jock and a bon vivant of his own making. Sure, he had dreams of fortune, but my dad, Milton, was always more than satisfied with what was in front of him. He had been a semipro basketball player for a brief time, standing at the towering height of five foot eight, and was so quick on his feet that he beat the New York City quarter-mile champ in a race once, wearing street shoes. He trained boxers and became a physical education teacher, an outdoorsman, and a fly-fishing fanatic. He had the bank account to show for it. <br><br> When I was a boy, my uncle Herbie, my dad's brother, once told me, "Your father is the most successful man I know."<br><br> "Why?" I asked.<br><br> "Because he has no ambition at all."<br><br> His love was always good enough for me. Mother always wanted more. A quick divorce was imminent, and after she married my wealthy stepfather and carted me off to the suburbs, I was always trying to find my way back to my father. I'd escape during the middle of the day and at night. I'd sneak onto trains, run from the Harlem stop to his apartment, and listen to him in the other room on the phone with my mother.<br><br> "I've got him," he'd say, and in the days or hours we could spend together, I'd have him, following him everywhere. He was my protector, my hero.<br><br> "Someday you'll understand," he'd said about the fight and ensuing legal battle over my custody. He was right. Eventually, I understood. But eventually takes a long time to arrive. <br><br> You Are Who You Know<br><br> In the mornings, I'd stay on the couch under the sheets he kept for me in the closet and listen to him leave about half an hour before the sun came up. He'd kiss me on the forehead, then disappear out the front door to do roadwork. For a time, he was managing a prizefighter, an Irish prospect turned stumblebum named Jerry McCarthy, whose idea of roadwork was six miles followed by at least six Tom Collinses.<br><br> "He's a coward," he told me about McCarthy. "He can only fight when he's drunk."<br><br> After those runs, he'd dress up, slipping his coach's whistle around his neck, and wait for the Colonel. The Colonel was an odd character who, like so many, adored my father; in his case, so much so that he volunteered to be his chauffeur. The Colonel was the owner of an old Lincoln that was so beat-up it would have drawn glares and jeers in Tijuana. My father didn't care what the car looked like. He saluted him with ceremony every morning.<br><br> "Colonel, take me uptown," he'd say, snapping his hand in a salute like a field commander.<br><br> "Yes, sir," the Colonel would say, saluting with the wrong hand and steering his limousine of sorts in the direction of James Monroe, the high school where my father worked, in Fort Apache, then and now one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the Bronx. There he maintained an eclectic group of friends-the maintenance staff, the crossing guards-and during breaks he would disappear into the boiler room to take a slug from his discreetly stashed bottle of Hiram Walker bourbon and play a few games of pinochle with the janitors and other coaches. He never spent the money he earned in those card games on himself; instead, he used his winnings on new uniforms, shoes, and equipment for students who couldn't afford them. He must have been up in winnings one year, because he financed his own basketball team and snuck them into the high school league.</p><h2>The Trouble with Honor (The Cabot Sisters)</h2><p>Passion and scandal collide in New York Times bestselling author Julia London&#x2019;s brand-new series about four sisters determined to rescue themselves from ruin...<br><br>Desperate times call for daring measures as Honor Cabot, the eldest stepdaughter of the wealthy Earl of Beckington, awaits her family&#x2019;s ruin.

The interior was sumptuous, with thick red velvet draperies, rich wood and low ceilings. Night after night, they came from their stately Mayfair homes in heavily armed coaches to spend an evening losing outrageous sums of money to one another. And when a gentleman had lost his allotted amount for the evening, he might enjoy the company of a lightskirt, as there were ample private rooms and French women to choose from.<br><br>On a bitterly cold night, a month before the start of the social Season-when, inevitably, the gentlemen would eschew this gaming hell for the Mayfair assembly rooms and balls that had become a spring rite for the wealthy and privileged-a group of young Corinthians were persuaded by the smiles and pretty pleas of five debutantes to have a look at this gaming hell.<br><br>It was dangerous and foolish for the young men to risk forever marring the reputations of such precious flowers. But young, brash and full of piss, they'd been eager to please. They did not allow the hell's rule of no women to deter them, or that any number of mishaps or crimes could befall the young women in the course of their lark. It was a bit of adventure in the middle of a gloomy winter.<br><br>It was in that Southwark gaming hell where George Easton first made the acquaintance of one of those debutantes: Miss Honor Cabot.<br><br>He hadn't noticed the commotion at the door when the young bucks had arrived with their prizes, flush with the excitement of their daring and overly proud for having convinced the man at the door to give them entry. George had been too intent on divesting thirty pounds from Mr. Charles Rutherford, a notorious gambler, in the course of a game of Commerce. He didn't realize anything was amiss until Rutherford said, "What the devil?"<br><br>It was then that he noticed the young women standing like so many birds, fluttering and preening in the middle of the room, their hooded cloaks framing their lovely faces, their giggles infecting one another while their gazes darted between the many men who eyed them like a paddock full of fine horses.<br><br>"Bloody hell," George muttered. He threw down his cards as Rutherford stood, the poor lass in his lap stumbling as she tried to stop herself from being dumped onto the floor.<br><br>"What in blazes are they doing here?" Rutherford demanded. He squinted at the group of them. "Bloody unconscionable, it is. See here!" he rumbled loudly. "This is not to be borne! Those girls should be removed at once!"<br><br>The three young gentlemen who had undertaken this adventure looked at one another. The smallest one lifted his chin. "They've as much right to be present as you, sir."<br><br>George could see from Mr. Rutherford's complexion that he was in danger of apoplexy, and he said, quite casually, "Then, for God's sake, have them sit and play. Otherwise, they're a distraction to the gentlemen here."<br><br>"Play?" Rutherford said, his eyes all but bulging from their sockets. "They are not fit to play!"<br><br>"I am," said one lone feminine voice.<br><br>Ho there, which of them dared to speak? George leaned around Rutherford to have a look, but the birds were fluttering and moving, and he couldn't see which of them had said it.<br><br>"Who said that?" Rutherford demanded loudly enough that the gentlemen seated at the tables around them paused in their games to see what was the commotion.<br><br>None of the young ladies moved; they stared wide-eyed at the banker. Just as it seemed Rutherford would begin a rant, one of them shyly stepped forward. A ripple went through the crowd as the lass looked at Rutherford and then at George. He was startled by the deep blue of her eyes and her dark lashes, the inky black of her hair framing a face as pale as milk. One did not expect to see such youthful beauty here.<br><br>"Miss Cabot?" Rutherford said incredulously. "What in blazes are <em>you</em> doing here?"<br><br>She curtsied as if she were standing in the middle of a ballroom and clasped her gloved hands before her.<br><br>"My friends and I have come to see for ourselves where it is that all the gentlemen keep disappearing to."<br><br>Chuckles ran through the crowd. Rutherford looked alarmed, as if he were somehow responsible for this breach of etiquette. "Miss Cabot...this is <em>no</em> place for a virtuous young lady."<br><br>One of the birds behind her fluttered and whispered at her, but Miss Cabot seemed not to notice. "Pardon, sir, but I don't understand how a place can be quite all right for a virtuous man, yet not for a virtuous woman."<br><br>George couldn't help but laugh. "Perhaps because there is no such thing as a virtuous man."<br><br>Those startlingly blue eyes settled on George once more, and he felt a strange little flicker in his chest. Her gaze dipped to the cards. "Commerce?" she asked.<br><br>"Yes," George said, impressed that she recognized it. "If you desire to play, miss, then bloody well do it."<br><br>Now all the blood had drained from Rutherford's face, and George was somewhat amused that he looked close to fainting. <em>"No,"</em> Rutherford said, shaking his head and holding up a hand to her. "I beg your pardon, Miss Cabot, but I <em>cannot</em> abet you in this folly. You must go home at once."<br><br>Miss Cabot looked disappointed.<br><br>"Then I'll do it," George said and, with his boot, kicked out a chair at his table. Another murmur shot through the crowd, and the tight group of little birds began to flutter again, the bottoms of their cloaks swirling about the floor as they twisted and turned to whisper at each other. "Whom do I have the pleasure of abetting?" he asked.<br><br>"Miss Cabot," she said. "Of Beckington House."<br><br>The Earl of Beckington's daughter, was she? Did she say that to impress him? Because it didn't. George shrugged. "George Easton. From Easton House."<br><br>The girls behind her giggled, but Miss Cabot did not. She smiled prettily at him. "A pleasure, Mr. Easton."<br><br>George supposed she'd learned to smile like that very early on in life in order to have what she liked. She was, he thought, a remarkably attractive woman. "These are not parlor games, miss. Have you any coin?"<br><br>"I do," she said, and held out her reticule to show him.<br><br>Lord, she was naive. "You'd best put that away," he said. "Behind the silk neckcloths and polished leather boots, you'll find a den of thieves between these walls."<br><br>"At least we've a purse, Easton, and haven't sunk it all in a boat," someone said.<br><br>Several gentlemen laughed at that, but George ignored them. He'd come to his fortune with cunning and hard work, and some men were jealous of it.<br><br>He gestured for the lovely Miss Cabot to sit. "You scarcely seem old enough to understand the nuances of a game such as Commerce."<br><br>"No?" she asked, one brow arching above the other as she gracefully took a seat in the chair that a man held out for her. "At what age is one considered old enough to engage in a game of chance?"<br><br>Behind her, the birds whispered fiercely, but Miss Cabot calmly regarded George, waiting for his answer. She was not, he realized, even remotely intimidated by him, by the establishment or by anything else.<br><br>"I would not presume to put an age on it," he said cavalierly. "A child, for all I care."<br><br>"Easton," Rutherford said, his voice full of warning, but George Easton did not play by the same rules as the titled men here, and Rutherford knew it. This would be diverting; George had no objection to passing an hour or so with a woman-anyone in London would attest to that-particularly one as comely as this one. "Are you prepared to lose all the coins you've brought?"<br><br>She laughed, the sound of it sparkling. "I don't intend to lose them at all."<br><br>The gentlemen in the room laughed again, and one or two of them stood, moving closer to watch.<br><br>"One must always be prepared to lose, Miss Cabot," George warned her.<br><br>She carefully opened her reticule, produced a few coins and smiled proudly at him. George made a mental note not to be swept up by that smile...at least not while at the gaming table.<br><br>Rutherford, meanwhile, stared with shock at both Miss Cabot and George, then slowly, reluctantly, took his seat.<br><br>"Shall I deal?" George asked, holding up the deck of cards.<br><br>"Please," Miss Cabot said, and put her gloves aside, neatly stacked, just beside her few coins. She glanced around the room as George shuffled the deck of cards. "Do you know that I have never been south of the Thames? Can you imagine, my whole life spent in and around London, and I've never come south of the Thames?"<br><br>"Imagine," he drawled, and dealt the cards. "Your bet to begin, Miss Cabot."<br><br>She glanced at her cards that were lying faceup, and put a shilling in the middle of the table.<br><br>"A bob will not take you far in this game," George said.<br><br>"Is it allowed?"<br><br>He shrugged. "It is." She merely smiled.<br><br>Rutherford followed suit, and the woman who had occupied his lap for most of the evening resumed her seat, sliding onto his knee, her gaze challenging Miss Cabot.<br><br><em>"Oh,"</em> Miss Cabot murmured, apparently as she realized what sort of woman would sit on Rutherford's lap, and glanced away.<br><br>"Are you shocked?" George whispered, amused.<br><br>"A bit," Miss Cabot responded, stealing a look at the young whore again. "I rather thought she'd be...homelier. But she's quite pretty, isn't she?"<br><br>George glanced at the woman on Rutherford's lap. He would call her alluring. But not pretty. Miss Cabot was pretty.<br><br>He glanced at his hand-he held a pair of kings. This would be an easy victory, he thought, and made his bet.<br><br>A servant walked by with a platter of food for a table that had resumed its play. Miss Cabot's gaze followed it.<br><br>"Miss Cabot," George said.<br><br>She looked at him.<br><br>"Your play."<br><br>"Oh!" She studied the cards and picked up another shilling and placed it in the middle.<br><br>"Gentlemen, we've had two bobs bet this evening. At this rate, we might hope to conclude the game at dawn."<br><br>Miss Cabot smiled at him, her blue eyes twinkling with amusement.<br><br>George reminded himself that he was not to be drawn in by pretty eyes, either.<br><br>They went round again, during which Rutherford apparently forgot his reluctance to play with the debutante. On the next round, Miss Cabot put in two shillings.<br><br>"Miss Cabot, have a care. You don't want to lose all you have in the first game," one of the young bucks said with a nervous laugh.<br><br>"I hardly think it will hurt any less to lose all that I have in one game or six, Mr. Eckersly," she said jovially.<br><br>George won the hand as he knew he would, but Miss Cabot didn't seem the least bit put off by it. "I think there should be more games of chance at the assembly halls, don't you?" she asked of the growing crowd around them. "It makes for a better diversion than whist."<br><br>"Only if one is winning," a man in the back of the crowd said.<br><br>"And with her father's money," Miss Cabot quipped, delighting the small but growing crowd around them, as well as the birds who had accompanied her, as they now had the attention of several gentlemen around them.<br><br>They continued on that way, with Miss Cabot betting a shilling here or there, bantering with the crowd. It was not the sort of high-stakes game George enjoyed, but he did enjoy Miss Cabot, very much. She was not like what he would have supposed for a debutante. She was witty and playful, delighting in her small victories, debating the play of her cards with whomever happened to be standing behind her.<br><br>After an hour had passed, Miss Cabot's purse was reduced to twenty pounds. She began to deal the cards. "Shall we raise the stakes?" she asked cheerfully.<br><br>"If you think you can afford my stakes, you have my undivided attention," George said.<br><br>She gave him a pert look. "Twenty pounds to play," she said, and began to deal.<br><br>George couldn't help but laugh at her na�vet�. "But that's all you have," he pointed out.<br><br>"Then perhaps you will take my marker?" she asked, and lifted her gaze to his. Her eyes, he couldn't help noticing, were still sparkling. But in a slightly different way. She was challenging him. Heaven help him, the girl was up to something, and George could not have been more delighted. He grinned.<br><br>"Miss Cabot, I must advise you against it," one of the bucks said, the same one who had grown more nervous as the game had progressed. "It's time we returned to Mayfair."<br><br>"Your caution and timekeeping are duly noted and appreciated, sir," she said sweetly, her gaze still on George. "You'll humor me, won't you, Mr. Easton?" she asked. "You'll take my marker?"<br><br>George had never been one to refuse a lady, particularly one he found so intriguing. "Consider yourself humored," he said with a gracious bow of his head. "I shall take your marker."<br><br>Word that he had taken a marker from Miss Cabot spread quickly through the gaming hell, and in a matter of minutes, more had gathered around to watch the debutante lose presumably something of value to George<br><br>Easton, the notorious and self-proclaimed bastard son of the late Duke of Gloucester.<br><br>The betting went higher among the three of them until Rutherford, who was undone by the prospect of having a debutante owe him money, withdrew from the game. That left George and Miss Cabot. She remained remarkably unruffled. It was just like the Mayfair set, George thought. She had no regard for the amount of her father's money she was losing-it was all magic for her, markers and coins appearing from thin air.<br><br>The bet had reached one hundred pounds, and George paused. While he appreciated her spirit, he was not in the habit of taking such a sum from debutantes. "The bet is now one hundred pounds, Miss Cabot. Will your papa put that amount in your reticule?" he asked, and the men around him laughed appreciatively.<br><br>"My goodness, Mr. Easton, that's a personal question, isn't it? Perhaps I should inquire if <em>you</em> will have one hundred pounds in your pocket if I should win?"<br><br>Cheeky thing. There was quite a lot of murmuring around them, and George could only imagine the delight her remark had brought the gentlemen in this room. He tossed in a handful of banknotes and winked at her.<br><br>"Indeed I will."<br><br>She matched his bet with a piece of paper someone had handed her, signing her name to the one hundred pounds owed.<br><br>George laid out his cards. He had a sequence of three, the ten being the highest. The only hand that could beat his was a tricon, or three of a kind, and indeed, Miss Cabot gasped with surprise. "My, that's impressive!" she said.<br><br>"I've been playing these games quite a long time."<br><br>"Yes, of course you have." She lifted her gaze and smiled at him, and the moment she did, George knew he'd been beaten. Her smile was too saucy, too triumphant.<br><br>As she laid out her hand, gasps went up all around them, followed by applaus...</p><h2>Alice in Zombieland (White Rabbit Chronicles, Book 1) (The White Rabbit Chronicles, 1)</h2><p><em>She won't rest until she's sent every walking corpse back to its grave.

Mom was short, barely over five-three, and I wasn't sure Em would even make it to five-one. Me? I had wavy white-blond hair, big blue eyes and legs that stretched for miles. At five-ten, I was taller than most of the boys at my school and always stood out&#x2014;I couldn't go anywhere without getting a few what-are-you-a-giraffe? stares.<br><br>Boys had never shown an interest in me, but I couldn't count the number of times I had caught one drooling over my mom as she walked by or&#x2014;gag&#x2014;heard one whistle as she bent over to pick something up.<br><br><em>"Alless."</em> At my side now, Em stomped her slippered foot in a bid for my attention. "Are you even listening to me?"<br><br>"Sweetie, we've gone over this, like, a thousand times. Your recital might start while it's sunny out, but it'll end at dark. You know Dad will never let us leave the house. And Mom agreed to sign you up for the program as long as you swore never to throw a tantrum when you couldn't make a practice or a, what? Recital."<br><br>She stepped over me and planted those dainty pink slippers at my shoulders, her slight body throwing a large enough shadow to shield my face from the overhead glare. She became all that I could see, shimmering gold pleading down at me. "Today's your birthday, and I know, I know, I forgot this morning...and this afternoon...but last week I remembered that it was coming up&#x2014;<em>you</em> remember how I told Mom, right?&#x2014;and now I've remembered again, so doesn't that count for something? 'Course it does," she added before I could say anything. "Daddy <em>has</em> to do whatever you ask. So, if you ask him to let us go, and...and..." so much longing in her tone "...and ask if he'll come and watch me, too, then he will."<br><br>My birthday. Yeah. My parents had forgotten, too. Again. Unlike Em, they hadn't remembered&#x2014;and wouldn't. Last year, my dad had been a little too busy throwing back shots of single malt and mumbling about monsters only he could see and my mom had been a little too busy cleaning up his mess. As always.<br><br>This year, Mom had hidden notes in drawers to remind herself (I'd found them), and as Em had claimed, my baby sis had even hinted before flat out saying, "Hey, Alice's birthday is coming up and I think she deserves a party!" but I'd woken up this morning to the same old same old. Nothing had changed.<br><br>Whatever. I was a year older, finally sweet sixteen, but my life was still the same. Honestly, it wasn't a big deal. I'd stopped caring a long time ago.<br><br>Em, though, she cared. She wanted what I'd never had: their undivided attention.<br><br>"Since today's my birthday, shouldn't <em>you</em> be doing something for me?" I asked, hoping to tease her into forgetting about her first ballet performance and the princess role she liked to say she "had been born to perform."<br><br>She fisted her hands on her hips, all innocence and indignation and, well, my favorite thing in the entire world. "Hello! Letting you do this for me <em>is</em> my gift to you."<br><br>I tried not to grin. "Is that so?"<br><br>"Yeah, because I know you want to watch me so badly you're practically foaming at the mouth."<br><br>Brat. But like I could really argue with her logic. I did want to watch her.<br><br>I remember the night Emma was born. A wild mix of fear and elation had seared the memory into my mind. Just like my parents had done with me, they had opted to use a midwife who made house calls so that, when the big moment arrived, Mom wouldn't have to leave home.<br><br>But even that plan had failed.<br><br>The sun had already set by the time her contractions started and my dad had refused to open the door to the midwife, too afraid a monster would follow her in.<br><br>So, <em>Dad</em> had delivered Emma while my mom nearly screamed us all to death. I had hidden under my covers, crying and shaking because I'd been so afraid.<br><br>When everything had finally quieted, I'd snuck into their bedroom to make sure everyone had survived. Dad bustled about while Mom lounged on the bed. Tentative steps had taken me to the edge, and, to be honest, I'd gasped in horror. Baby Emma had <em>not</em> been attractive. She'd been red and wrinkly, with the most hideous dark hair on her ears. (I'm happy to say the hair has since been shed.) Mom had been all smiles as she waved me over to hold my "new best friend."<br><br>I'd settled beside her, pillows fluffing behind me, and she'd placed the wiggly bundle in my arms. Eyes so beautiful only God Himself could have created them had peered up at me, rosy lips puckering and tiny fists waving.<br><br>"What should we name her?" Mom had asked.<br><br>When short, chubby fingers had wrapped around one of mine, skin soft and warm, I'd decided that hair on the ears wasn't such a terrible thing, after all. "Lily," I'd replied. "We should name her Lily." I had a book all about flowers, and the lilies were my favorites.<br><br>My mom's soft chuckle had washed over me. "I like that. How about Emmaline Lily Bell, since Nana's real name is Emmaline and it'd be nice to honor my mother the way we honored your dad's when you were born. We can call our little miracle Emma for short, and the three of us will share a wonderful secret. You're my Alice Rose and she's my Emma Lily, and together the two of you are my perfect bouquet."<br><br>I hadn't needed time to think about that. "Okay. Deal!"<br><br>Emma had gurgled, and I'd taken that as approval.<br><br>"Alice Rose," Emma said now. "You're lost in your head again, when I've never needed you more."<br><br>"All right, fine," I said on a sigh. I just couldn't deny her. Never had, never would. "I'm not talking to Dad, though. I'm talking to Mom and making her talk to him."<br><br>The first sparkle of hope ignited. "Really?"<br><br>"Yes, really."<br><br>A brilliant smile bloomed, and her bouncing started up again. "Please, Alice. You gotta talk to her now. I don't want to be late, and if Dad agrees we'll need to leave soon so I can warm up on stage with the other girls. Please. <em>Nooow."</em><br><br>I sat up and placed the daisies around her neck. "You know the likelihood of success is pretty low, right?"<br><br>A cardinal rule in the Bell household: you did not leave the house if you couldn't return before dark. Here, Dad had worked up "reinforcements" against the monsters, ensuring none of them could get in. After dark, well, you stayed put. Anyone out in the big bad world was without any type of protection and considered open season.<br><br>My father's paranoia and delusion had caused me to miss numerous school activities and countless sporting events. I'd never even been on a date. Yes, I could have gone on a weekend lunch date and other craptasticly lame things like that, but honestly? I had no desire for a boyfriend. I never wanted to have to explain that my dad was certifiable, or that he sometimes locked us in the "special" basement he'd built as added protection from a boogeyman that did not exist. Yeah, just peachy.<br><br>Em threw her arms around me. "You can do it, I know you can. You can do anything!"<br><br>Her faith in me...so humbling. "I'll do my best."<br><br>"Your best is&#x2014; Oh, ick!" Face scrunched with horror, she jumped as far away from me as she could get. "You're all gross and wet, and you made <em>me</em> all gross and wet."<br><br>Laughing, I lunged for her. She squealed and darted off. I'd run the hose over myself about half an hour ago, hoping to cool down. Not that I'd tell her. The fun of sibling torture, and all that.<br><br>"Stay out here, okay?" Mom would say something that would hurt her feelings, and I'd say something to make her feel bad for asking me to do this, and she'd cry. I hated when she cried.<br><br>"Sure, sure," she said, palms up in a gesture of innocence.<br><br>Like I was buying that hasty assurance. She planned to follow me and listen, no question. Girl was devious like that. "Promise me."<br><br>"I can't believe you'd doubt me." A delicate hand fluttered over her heart. "That hurts, Alice. That really hurts."<br><br>"First, major congrats. Your acting has improved tremendously," I said with a round of applause. "Second, say the words or I'll return to working on a tan I'll never achieve."<br><br>Grinning, she rose on her toes, stretched out her arms and slowly spun on one leg. The sun chose that moment to toss out an amber ray, creating the perfect spotlight for her perfect pirouette. "Okay, okay. I promise. Happy now?"<br><br>"Sublimely." She might be devious, but she never broke a promise.<br><br>"Watch me pretend I know what that means."<br><br>"It means&#x2014;oh, never mind." I was stalling, and I knew it. "I'm going."<br><br>With all the enthusiasm of a firing squad candidate, I stood and turned toward our house, a two-story my dad had built in the prime of his construction days, with brown brick on the bottom and brown-and-white-striped wood on the top.<br><br>Kind of boxy, amazingly average and absolutely, one hundred percent forgettable. But then, that's what he'd been going for, he'd said.<br><br>My flip-flops clapped against the ground, creating a mantra inside my head. <em>Don't. Fail. Don't. Fail.</em> Finally I stood at the glass doors that led to our kitchen and spotted my mom, bustling from the sink to the stove and back again. I watched her, a bit sick to my stomach.<br><br><em>Don't be a wuss. You can do this.</em><br><br>I pushed my way inside. Garlic, butter and tomato paste scented the air. "Hey," I said, and hoped I hadn't cringed.<br><br>Mom glanced up from the steaming strainer of noodles and smiled. "Hey, baby. Coming in for good, or just taking a break?"<br><br>"Break." The forced incarceration at night drove me to spend as much time as possible outside during daylight hours, whether I burned to lobster-red or not.<br><br>"Well, your timing's great. The spaghetti's almost done."<br><br>"Yeah, okay, good." During the summer months, we ate dinner at five sharp. Winter, we switched it up to four. That way, no matter the season, we could be in our rooms and safe before sunset.<br><br>The walls were reinforced with some kind of steel, and the doors and locks were impenetrable. And yes, those things made our futuristic dungeon known as "the basement" overkill, but you try reasoning with a crazy person.<br><br><em>Just do it. Just say it.</em> "So, um, yeah." I shifted from one foot to the other. "Today's my birthday."<br><br>Her jaw dropped, her cheeks bleaching of color. "Oh...baby. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean... I should have remem-bered.I even made myself notes. Happy birthday," she finished lamely. She looked around, as if hoping a present would somehow appear via the force of her will. "I feel terrible."<br><br>"Don't worry about it."<br><br>"I'll do something to make this up to you, I swear." <em>And so the negotiations have begun.</em> I squared my shoulders. "Do you really mean that?"<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>"Good, because Em has a recital tonight and I want to go."<br><br>Though my mom radiated sadness, she was shaking her head even before I finished. "You know your dad will never agree."<br><br>"So talk to him. Convince him."<br><br>"I can't."<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>"Because." A croak.<br><br>I loved this woman, I truly did, but, oh, she could frustrate me like no one else. "Because why?" I insisted. Even if she cried, I wasn't dropping this. Better her tears than Em's.<br><br>Mom pivoted, as graceful as Emma as she carried the strainer to the pot and dumped the contents inside. Steam rose and wafted around her, and for a moment, she looked as if she were part of a dream. "Emma knows the rules. She'll understand."<br><br>The way I'd had to understand, time and time again before I'd just given up? Anger sparked. "Why do you do this? Why do you always agree with him when you know he's off-the-charts insane?"<br><br>"He's not&#x2014;"<br><br>"He is!" Like Em, I stomped my foot.<br><br>"Quiet," she said, her tone admonishing. "He's upstairs."<br><br>Yeah, and I'd bet he was already drunk.<br><br>She added, "We've talked about this, honey. I believe your dad sees something the rest of us can't. But before you cast stones at him or me, take a look at the Bible. Once upon a time our Lord and Savior was persecuted. Tons of people doubted Jesus."<br><br>"Dad isn't Jesus!" He rarely even went to church with us.<br><br>"I know, and that's not what I'm saying. I believe there are forces at work all around us. Forces for good and forces for evil."<br><br>I couldn't get involved in another good/evil debate with her. I just couldn't. I believed in God, and I believed there were angels and demons out there, but we never had to deal with the evil stuff, did we? "I wish you would divorce him," I muttered, then bit my tongue in regret&#x2014;but even still, I refused to apologize.<br><br>She worked from home seven days a week as a medical transcriptionist, and was always type, type, typing away at her computer. On weekends, like this fine Saturday evening, she acted like my dad's nursemaid, too, cleaning him up, fetching and carrying for him. She deserved so much more. She was young, for a mom, and so dang pretty. She was softhearted and funny and deserved some pampering of her own.<br><br>"Most kids want their parents to stay together," she said, a sharp edge to her voice.<br><br>"I'm not like most kids. You guys made sure of that." There was an even sharper edge to <em>my</em> voice.<br><br>I just.I wanted what other kids had. A normal life.<br><br>In a snap, the anger drained from her and she sighed. "Alice, honey, I know this is hard. I know you want more for yourself, and one day you'll have it. You'll graduate, get a job, move out, go to college, fall in love, travel, do whatever your heart desires. As for now, this is your father's house and he makes the rules. You will follow those rules and respect his authority."<br><br>Straight out of the Parent's Official Handbook, right under the heading: <em>What to say when you don't have a real answer for your kid.</em><br><br></p><h2>Themes in Religion and American Culture</h2><p>Designed to serve as an introduction to American religion, this volume is distinctive in its approach: instead of following a traditional narrative, the book is arranged thematically. Eleven chapters by top scholars present, in carefully organized and accessible fashion, topics and perspectives fundamental to the understanding of religion in America. Some of the chapters treat aspects of faith typical to most religious groups, such as theology, proselytization, supernaturalism, and cosmology. Others deal with race, ethnicity, gender, the state, economy, science, diversity, and regionalism--facets of American culture that often interact with religion. <br><br>Each topical essay is structured chronologically, divided into sections on pre-colonial, colonial, revolutionary and early republican, antebellum, postbellum and late nineteenth-century, early twentieth-century, and modern America. One can study the extended history of a certain theme, or read "across" the book for a study of all the themes during a specific period in history. This book's new approach offers a rich analysis of the genuine complexity of American religious life. With a helpful glossary of basic religious terms, movements, people, and groups, this book will become an essential tool for students and teachers of religion.<br>Contributors:<br>Yvonne Chireau, Swarthmore College<br>Amy DeRogatis, Michigan State University<br>William Durbin, Washington Theological Union<br>Tracy Fessenden, Arizona State University<br>James German, State University of New York, Potsdam<br>Philip Goff, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis<br>Paul Harvey, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs<br>Sue Marasco, Vanderbilt University <br>Winnifred Fallers Sullivan, University of Chicago Divinity School<br>Roberto Trevino, University of Texas, Arlington<br>David Weaver-Zercher, Messiah College<br><br><br><br></p><p>"This textbook, which enlists some of the best and brightest scholars of the younger generation, synthesizes the latest developments in the field in a series of thematic essays. It provides a major alternative to textbooks organized chronologically or by traditions and should definitely find a place in undergraduate courses on American religious history."--Ann Taves, Claremont School of Theology <br>This coursebook for an introduction to American religious history takes a thematic approach. Eleven essays approach different themes in American religious history, with each essay taking a chronological approach to its subject. Themes include theologies, supernaturalism, race, gender, the state, and science. Also includes a glossary of basic religious terms, movements, people, and groups.</p><h2>Trilogy on Faith and Happiness (The Augustine Series) (Works of Saint Augustine)</h2><p>Augustine of Hippo, one of the most prolific writers of late antiquity, known primarily for four masterpieces: <i>The Confessions, Teaching Christianity, The City of God, </i> and <i>The Trinity, </i> composed a vast body of work comprised of more than five million words. He composed his earliest works in the form of dialogues shortly before his baptism in 387. The next decade of his life, a relatively unproductive transitional period, was followed by an explosion that averaged, in modern terms, a 300-page book per year. This early trilogy, <i>The Happy Life, The Advantage of Believing, </i> and <i>Faith in the Unseen, </i> demonstrates Augustines fundamental concern to link Christian faith with the human quest for happiness. These three essential works, which illustrate his dictum that faith is necessary for understanding, constitute a magnificent introduction to Augustinian spirituality. <p><i>Trilogy on Faith and Happiness</i> reveals Augustines insight into fundamental existential questions and his conviction that human fulfillment can be found only in the incarnation of Jesus, the Word and Wisdom of God. It will prove especially useful for spiritual reading and for students of Christian spirituality.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Need to Hold Still: Poems</h2><p><p>Winner of the National Book Award for Poetry</p><p>An adventurer, Lisel Mueller pursues the protean possibilities of communication.

Their first-person narratives, selected and edited by Jo Ella Powell Exley, provide a gripping, highly personal history of the state from Stephen F. Austin's original settlement through the taming of its last frontier in the west.<br><br> The stories in <i>Texas Tears and Texas Sunshine</i> cover nearly a century, from the log cabin days of Anglo colonization and the Old Three Hundred to the settlement of the South Plains in the early twentieth century. Through the years, Indian raids, frontier-style "society balls," the Runaway Scrape, plantation life, yellow fever, trail drives, and the bloody Council House fight in San Antonio provided some of the blocks for this quilt. The rugged sunshine of daily life and the tears of frontier hardship combine in fascinating, realistic patterns. <br><br>" . . . a fascinating collection of some of the Texas women's experiences. . . . <i>Texas Tears and Texas Sunshine</i>, a realistic look at the women of the frontier, is a book that also instills lessons of pride and courage for today."&#x2014;<i>Southern Living</i></p><p>JO ELLA POWELL EXLEY is herself a fifth-generation descendant of Texas pioneers.

Most came from humble families, all lived far from the centre of things, but they were young and their optimism was boundless: together they would change the world. Among them were the ambitious toy-maker Matthew Boulton and his partner James Watt, of steam-engine fame; the potter Josiah Wedgewood; the larger-than-life Erasmus Darwin, physician, poet, inventor and theorist of evolution (a forerunner of his grandson Charles). Later came Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen and fighting radical. With a small band of allies they formed the Lunar Society of Birmingham (so called because it met at each full moon) and kick-started the Industrial Revolution. Blending science, art and commerce, the &#34;Lunar Men&#34; built canals, launched balloons, named plants, gases and minerals, changed the face of England and the china in its drawing rooms and plotted to revolutionize its soul. This exhilarating account uncovers the friendships, political passions, love affairs, and love of knowledge (and power) that drove these extraordinary men. It echoes to the thud of pistons and the wheeze and snort of engines, and brings to life the tradesmen, artisans and tycoons who shaped and fired the modern age.</p><p>In the late 1700s, five gifted inventors and amateur scholars in Birmingham, England, came together for what one of them, Erasmus Darwin, called "a little philosophical laughing." They also helped kick-start the industrial revolution, as Jenny Uglow relates in the lively <i>The Lunar Men: Five Friends Whose Curiosity Changed the World</i>. Their "Lunar Society" included Joseph Priestley, the chemist who isolated oxygen; James Watt, the Scottish inventor of the steam engine; and Josiah Wedgwood, whose manufacture of pottery created the industrial model for the next century. Joined by other "toymakers" and scholarly tinkerers, they concocted schemes for building great canals and harnessing the power of electricity, coined words such as "hydrogen" and "iridescent," shared theories and bank accounts, fended off embezzlers and industrial spies, and forged a fine "democracy of knowledge." And they had a fine time doing so, proving that scholars need not be dullards or eccentrics asocial. <p> Uglow's spirited look at this group of remarkable "lunaticks" captures a critical, short-lived moment of early modern history. Readers who share their conviction that knowledge brings power will find this book a rewarding adventure. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Jenny Uglow grew up in Cumbria and now lives in Canterbury.

She lives in England.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>OK. Don&#x2019;t panic. I&#x2019;m in charge. I, Rebecca Brandon (n�e Bloomwood), am the adult. Not my two-year-old daughter.<br>Only I&#x2019;m not sure she realizes this.<br>&#x201c;Minnie, darling, give me the pony.&#x201d; I try to sound calm and assured, like Nanny Sue off the telly.<br>&#x201c;Poneeee.&#x201d; Minnie grips the toy pony more tightly.<br>&#x201c;No pony.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mine!&#x201d; she cries hysterically. &#x201c;Miiiine poneee!&#x201d;<br>Argh. I&#x2019;m holding about a million shopping bags, my face is sweating, and I could really do without this.<br>It was all going so well. I&#x2019;d been round the whole shopping mall and bought all the last little things on my Christmas list. Minnie and I were heading toward Santa&#x2019;s Grotto, and I only stopped for a moment to look at a dollhouse. Whereupon Minnie grabbed a toy pony off the display and refused to put it back. And now I&#x2019;m in the middle of Ponygate.<br>A mother in J Brand skinny jeans with an impeccably dressed daughter walks past, giving me the Mummy Once-Over, and I flinch. Since I had Minnie, I&#x2019;ve learned that the Mummy Once-Over is even more savage than the Manhattan Once-Over. In the Mummy Once-Over, they don&#x2019;t just assess and price your clothes to the nearest penny in one sweeping glance. Oh no. They also take in your child&#x2019;s clothes, pram brand, nappy bag, snack choice, and whether your child is smiling, snotty, or screaming.<br>Which I know is a lot to take in, in a one-second glance, but believe me, mothers are multitaskers.<br>Minnie definitely scores top marks for her outfit. (Dress: one-off Danny Kovitz; coat: Rachel Riley; shoes: Baby Dior.) And I&#x2019;ve got her safely strapped into her toddler reins (Bill Amberg leather, really cool; they were in Vogue). But instead of smiling angelically like the little girl in the photo shoot, she&#x2019;s straining against them like a bull waiting to dash into the ring. Her eyebrows are knitted with fury, her cheeks are bright pink, and she&#x2019;s drawing breath to shriek again.<br>&#x201c;Minnie.&#x201d; I let go of the reins and put my arms round her so that she feels safe and secure, just like it recommends in Nanny Sue&#x2019;s book, Taming Your Tricky Toddler. I bought it the other day, to have a flick through. Just out of idle interest. I mean, it&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m having problems with Minnie or anything. It&#x2019;s not that she&#x2019;s difficult. Or &#x201c;out of control and willful,&#x201d; like that stupid teacher at the toddler music group said. (What does she know? She can&#x2019;t even play the triangle properly.)<br><p>The thing about Minnie is, she&#x2019;s . . . spirited. She has firm opinions about things. Like jeans (she won&#x2019;t wear them) or carrots (she won&#x2019;t eat them). And right now her firm opinion is that she should have a toy pony.<br>&#x201c;Minnie, darling, I love you very much,&#x201d; I say in a gentle, crooning voice, &#x201c;and it would make me very happy if you gave me the pony. That&#x2019;s right, give it to Mummy.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve nearly done it. My fingers are closing around the pony&#x2019;s head . . .<br>Ha. Skills. I&#x2019;ve got it. I can&#x2019;t help looking round to see if anyone&#x2019;s observed my expert parenting.<br>&#x201c;Miiiine!&#x201d; Minnie wrenches the pony out of my hand and makes a run for it across the shop floor. Shit.<br>&#x201c;Minnie! Minnie!&#x201d; I yell.<br>I grab my carrier bags and leg it furiously after Minnie, who has already disappeared into the Action Man section. God, I don&#x2019;t know why we bother training all these athletes for the Olympics. We should just field a team of toddlers.<br>As I catch up with her, I&#x2019;m panting. I really have to start my postnatal exercises sometime.<br>&#x201c;Give me the pony!&#x201d; I try to take it, but she&#x2019;s gripping it like a limpet.<br>&#x201c;Mine poneee!&#x201d; Her dark eyes flash at me with a resolute glint. Sometimes I look at Minnie and she&#x2019;s so like her father it gives me a jolt.<br>Speaking of which, where is Luke? We were supposed to be doing Christmas shopping together. As a family. But he disappeared an hour ago, muttering something about a call he had to make, and I haven&#x2019;t seen him since. He&#x2019;s probably sitting somewhere having a civilized cappuccino over the newspaper. Typical.<br>&#x201c;Minnie, we&#x2019;re not buying it,&#x201d; I say in my best firm manner. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got lots of toys already and you don&#x2019;t need a pony.&#x201d;<br>A woman with straggly dark hair, gray eyes, and toddlers in a twin buggy shoots me an approving nod. I can&#x2019;t help giving her the Mummy Once-Over myself, and she&#x2019;s one of those mothers who wears Crocs over nubbly homemade socks. (Why would you do that? Why?)<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s monstrous, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Those ponies are forty pounds! My kids know better than to even ask,&#x201d; she adds, shooting a glance at her two boys, who are slumped silently, thumbs in mouths. &#x201c;Once you give in to them, that&#x2019;s the beginning of the end. I&#x2019;ve got mine well trained.&#x201d;<br>Show-off.<br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; I say in dignified tones. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t agree more.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Some parents would just buy their kid that pony for a quiet life. No discipline. It&#x2019;s disgusting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Terrible,&#x201d; I agree, and make a surreptitious swipe for the pony, which Minnie adeptly dodges. Damn.<br>&#x201c;The biggest mistake is giving in to them.&#x201d; The woman is regarding Minnie with a pebblelike gaze. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what starts the rot.&#x201d;<br>Well, I never give in to my daughter,&#x201d; I say briskly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not getting the pony, Minnie, and that&#x2019;s final.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Poneeee!&#x201d; Minnie&#x2019;s wails turn to heartrending sobs. She is such a drama queen. (She gets it from my mum.)<br>&#x201c;Good luck, then.&#x201d; The woman moves off. &#x201c;Happy Christmas.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Minnie, stop!&#x201d; I hiss furiously as soon as she&#x2019;s disappeared. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re embarrassing both of us! What do you want a stupid pony for, anyway?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Poneeee!&#x201d; She&#x2019;s cuddling the pony to her as though it&#x2019;s her long-lost faithful pet that was sold at market five hundred miles away and has just stumbled back to the farm, footsore and whickering for her.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a silly toy,&#x201d; I say impatiently. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so special about it, anyway?&#x201d; And for the first time I look properly at the pony.<br>Wow. Actually . . . it is pretty fab. It&#x2019;s made of painted white wood with glittery stars all over and the sweetest hand-painted face. And it has little red trundly wheels.<br>&#x201c;You really don&#x2019;t need a pony, Minnie,&#x201d; I say&#x2014;but with slightly less conviction than before. I&#x2019;ve just noticed the saddle. Is that genuine leather? And it has a proper bridle with buckles and the mane is made of real horsehair. And it comes with a grooming set!<br>For forty quid this isn&#x2019;t bad value at all. I push one of the little red wheels, and it spins round perfectly. Now that I think about it, Minnie doesn&#x2019;t have a toy pony. It&#x2019;s quite an obvious gap in her toy cupboard.<br>I mean, not that I&#x2019;m going to give in.<br>&#x201c;It winds up too,&#x201d; comes a voice behind me, and I turn to see an elderly sales assistant approaching us. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a key in the base. Look!&#x201d;<br>She winds the key, and both Minnie and I watch, mesmerized, as the pony starts rising and falling in a carousel motion while tinkly music plays.<br>Oh my God, I love this pony.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s on special Christmas offer at forty pounds,&#x201d; the assistant adds. &#x201c;Normally this would retail for seventy. They&#x2019;re handmade in Sweden.&#x201d;<br>Nearly fifty percent off. I knew it was good value. Didn&#x2019;t I say it was good value?<br>&#x201c;You like it, don&#x2019;t you, dear?&#x201d; The assistant smiles at Minnie, who beams back, her stroppiness vanished. In fact, I don&#x2019;t want to boast, but she looks pretty adorable with her red coat and dark pigtails and dimpled cheeks. &#x201c;So, would you like to buy one?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I . . . um . . .&#x201d; I clear my throat.<br>Come on, Becky. Say no. Be a good parent. Walk away.<br>My hand steals out and strokes the mane again.<br>But it&#x2019;s so gorgeous. Look at its dear little face. And a pony isn&#x2019;t like some stupid craze, is it? You&#x2019;d never get tired of a pony. It&#x2019;s a classic. It&#x2019;s, like, the Chanel jacket of toys.<br>And it&#x2019;s Christmas. And it&#x2019;s on special offer. And, who knows, Minnie might turn out to have a gift for riding, it suddenly occurs to me. A toy pony might be just the spur she needs. I have a sudden vision of her at age twenty, wearing a red jacket, standing by a gorgeous horse at the Olympics, saying to the TV cameras, &#x201c;It all began one Christmas, when I received the gift that changed my life. . . .&#x201d;<br>My mind is going round and round like a computer processing DNA results, trying to find a match. There has to be a way in which I can simultaneously: 1) Not give in to Minnie&#x2019;s tan?trum; 2) be a good parent; and 3) buy the pony. I need some clever blue-sky solution like Luke is always paying business consultants scads of money to come up with . . .<br>And then the answer comes to me. A totally genius idea which I can&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;ve never had before. I haul out my phone and text Luke:<br>Luke! Have just had a really good thought. I think Minnie should get pocket money.<br>Immediately a reply pings back:<br>Wtf? Why?<br>So she can buy things, of course! I start to type. Then I think again. I delete the text and carefully type instead:<br>Children need to learn about finance from early age. Read it in article. Empowers them and gives responsibility.<br>A moment later Luke texts: Can&#x2019;t we just buy her the FT?<br>Shut up. I type: We&#x2019;ll say two pounds a week shall we?<br>R u mad? Comes zipping back: 10p a week is plenty.<br>I stare at the phone indignantly. 10p? He&#x2019;s such an old skinflint. What&#x2019;s she supposed to buy with that?<br>And we&#x2019;ll never afford the pony on 10p a week.<br>50p a week. I type firmly. Is national average. (He&#x2019;ll never check.) Where r u anyway? Nearly time for Father Christmas!!<br>OK whatever. I&#x2019;ll be there comes the reply.<br>Result! As I put away my phone, I&#x2019;m doing a quick mental calculation: Fifty pence a week for two years makes �52. Easy enough. God, why on earth have I never thought of pocket money before? It&#x2019;s perfect! It&#x2019;s going to add a whole new dimension to our shopping trips.<br>I turn to Minnie, feeling rather proud of myself.<br>&#x201c;Now, listen, darling,&#x201d; I announce. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to buy this pony for you, because I&#x2019;ve already said no. But as a special treat, you can buy it for yourself out of your own pocket money. Isn&#x2019;t that exciting?&#x201d;<br>Minnie eyes me uncertainly. I&#x2019;ll take that as a yes.<br>&#x201c;As you&#x2019;ve never spent any of your pocket money, you&#x2019;ve got two years&#x2019; worth, which is plenty. You see how great saving is?&#x201d; I add brightly. &#x201c;You see how fun it is?&#x201d;<br>As we walk to the checkout, I feel totally smug. Talk about responsible parenting. I&#x2019;m introducing my child to the principles of financial planning at an early age. I could be a guru on TV myself! Super Becky&#x2019;s Guide to Fiscally Responsible Parenting. I could wear different boots in each episode&#x2014;<br>&#x201c;Wagon.&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;m jolted out of my daydream to see that Minnie has dropped the pony and is now clutching a pink plastic monstrosity. Where did she get that? It&#x2019;s Winnie&#x2019;s Wagon, from that cartoon show.<br>&#x201c;Wagon?&#x201d; She raises her eyes hopefully.<br>What?<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not getting the wagon, darling,&#x201d; I say patiently. &#x201c;You wanted the pony. The lovely pony, remember?&#x201d;<br>Minnie surveys the pony with total indifference. &#x201c;Wagon.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Pony!&#x201d; I grab the pony off the floor.<br>This is so frustrating. How can she be so fickle? She definitely gets that trait from Mum.<br>&#x201c;Wagon!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Pony!&#x201d; I cry, more loudly than I meant to, and brandish the pony at her. &#x201c;I want the poneee&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Suddenly I get a prickly-neck feeling. I look round to see the woman with the toddler boys, standing a few yards away, staring at me with her pebblelike eyes.<br>&#x201c;I mean . . .&#x201d; I hastily lower the pony, my cheeks burning. &#x201c;Yes, you may buy the pony out of your pocket money. Basic financial planning,&#x201d; I add briskly to the pebble-eyed woman. &#x201c;What we learned today is that you have to save up before you can buy things, didn&#x2019;t we, darling? Minnie&#x2019;s spent all her pocket money on the pony, and it was a very good choice&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve found the other pony!&#x201d; The assistant suddenly appears again, breathless and carrying a dusty box. &#x201c;I knew we had one left in the stockroom; they were originally a pair, you see . . .&#x201d;<br>There&#x2019;s another pony?<br>I can&#x2019;t help gasping as she draws it out. It&#x2019;s midnight blue with a raven mane, speckled with stars, and with golden wheels. It&#x2019;s absolutely stunning. It complements the other one perfectly. Oh God, we have to have them both. We have to.<br>Rather annoyingly, the pebble-eyed woman is still standing there with her buggy, watching us.<br>&#x201c;Shame you&#x2019;ve spent all your pocket money, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; she says to Minnie with one of those tight, unfriendly smiles which proves she never has any fun or sex. You can always tell that about people, I find.<br>&#x201c;Yes, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I say politely. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a problem. So we&#x2019;ll have to think of a solution.&#x201d; I think hard for a moment, then turn to Minnie.<br>&#x201c;Darling, here&#x2019;s your second important lesson in financial planning. Sometimes, when we see an amazing one-off bargain, we can make an exception to the saving-up rule. It&#x2019;s called seizing the opportunity.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just going to buy it?&#x201d; says the pebble-eyed woman in tones of disbelief.<br>What business is it of hers? God, I hate other mothers. They always have to butt in. The minute you have a child, it&#x2019;s as if you&#x2019;ve turned into a box on an Internet site that says, Please add all your rude and offensive comments here.<br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m not going to buy it,&#x201d; I say, a little stonily. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll have to get it out of her own pocket money. Darling.&#x201d; I crouch down to get Minnie&#x2019;s attention. &#x201c;If you pay for the other pony out of your pocket money at fifty pence a week, it&#x2019;ll take about . . . sixty more weeks. You&#x2019;ll have to have an advance. Like an &#x2018;overdraft.&#x2019;?&#x201d; I enunciate clearly. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll basically have spent all your pocket money till you&#x2019;re three. All right?&#x201d;<br>Minnie looks a bit bewildered. But then, I expect I looked a bit bewildered when I took out my first overdraft. It goes with the territory.<br>&#x201c;All sorted.&#x201d; I beam at the assistant and hand over my Visa card. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take both ponies, thank you. You see, darling?&#x201d; I add to Minnie. &#x201c;The lesson we&#x2019;ve learned today is: Never give up on something you really want. However impossible things seem, there&#x2019;s always a way.&#x201d;<br>I can&#x2019;t help feeing proud of myself, imparting this nugget of wisdom. That&#x2019;s what parenting&#x2019;s all about. Teaching your child the ways of the world.<br>&#x201c;You know, I once found the most amazing opportunity,&#x201d; I add, as I punch in my PIN. &#x201c;It was a pair of Dolce and Gabbana boots at ninety percent off! Only, my credit card was up to my limit. But did I give up? No! Of course I didn&#x2019;t!&#x201d;<br>Minnie is listening as avidly as if I&#x2019;m recounting The Three Bears.<br>&#x201c;I went round my flat and searched in all my pockets and bags, and I collected up all my little coins&#x2014;and guess what?&#x201d; I pause for effect. &#x201c;I had enough money! I could get the boots! Hooray!&#x201d;<br>Minnie claps her hands, and to my delight, the toddler boys start cheering raucously.<br>&#x201c;Do you want to hear another story?&#x201d; I beam at them. &#x201c;Do you want to hear about the sample sale in Milan? I was walking along the street one day, when I saw this mysterious sign.&#x201d; I open my eyes wide. &#x201c;And what do you think it said?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ridiculous.&#x201d; The pebble-eyed woman turns her buggy with an abrupt gesture. &#x201c;Come on, it&#x2019;s time to go home.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Story!&#x201d; wails one of the boys.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not hearing the story,&#x201d; she snaps. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re insane,&#x201d; she adds over her shoulder as she strides off. &#x201c;No wonder your child&#x2019;s so spoiled. What are those little shoes of hers, then, Gucci?&#x201d;<br>Spoiled?<br>Blood zings to my face and I stare at her in speechless shock. Where did that come from? Mi...</p></p><h2>Don't Let the Sun Step Over You: A White Mountain Apache Family Life, 1860&#x2013;1975</h2><p><b>When the Apache wars ended in the late nineteenth century,</b> a harsh and harrowing time began for the Western Apache people. Living under the authority of nervous Indian agents, pitiless government-school officials, and menacing mounted police, they knew that resistance to American authority would be foolish. But some Apache families did resist in the most basic way they could: they resolved to endure. Although Apache history has inspired numerous works by non-Indian authors, Apache people themselves have been reluctant to comment at length on their own past. Eva Tulene Watt, born in 1913, now shares the story of her family from the time of the Apache wars to the modern era. Her narrative presents a view of history that differs fundamentally from conventional approaches, which have almost nothing to say about the daily lives of Apache men and women, their values and social practices, and the singular abilities that enabled them to survive.<br><br> In a voice that is spare, factual, and unflinchingly direct, Mrs. Watt reveals how the Western Apaches carried on in the face of poverty, hardship, and disease. Her interpretation of her people&#x2019;s past is a diverse assemblage of recounted events, biographical sketches, and cultural descriptions that bring to life a vanished time and the men and women who lived it to the fullest. We share her and her family&#x2019;s travels and troubles. We learn how the Apache people struggled daily to find work, shelter, food, health, laughter, solace, and everything else that people in any community seek.<br><br> Richly illustrated with more than 50 photographs, <i>Don&#x2019;t Let the Sun Step Over You</i> is a rare and remarkable book that affords a view of the past that few have seen before&#x2014;a wholly Apache view, unsettling yet uplifting, which weighs upon the mind and educates the heart.</p><p>A renowned moccasin maker and storyteller, Eva Tulene Watt is cultural advisor to the Nohwike Bagowa, the White Mountain Apache tribe's cultural center, was a charter member of the tribe's cultural advisory board, and also served as a key advisor to the Western Apache Place Names Survey. A recipient of the Arizona Indian Living Treasure Award, she lives with her son's family near Hon-Dah on the Fort Apache Reservation in Arizona. Keith Basso, whom Eva Watt invited to record her narrative, is University Regents Professor of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico and a leading expert on Apache culture, language, and history. Among his books are <i>Wisdom Sits in Places: Landscape and Language Among the Western Apache,</i> winner of the Western States Book Award, the Victor Turner Prize, and the J. I.

The complexity upon complexity in all life systems and the presence of exponentially increasing numbers of missing links as science marches on decimates the faith in an exploding speck within a vacuum of nothingness forming anything.

(&#34;Daily Mail&#34;)</p><h2>The Faith of a Physicist (Theology &amp; the Sciences Series)</h2><p>&#34;It has become fashionable to write books with titles such as Religion in an Age of Science (Barbour), Theology for a Scientific Age (Peacocke), or Theology in the Age of Scientific Reasoning (Murphy). They signify the recognition that the interaction between science and religious reflection is not limited to those topics (such as cosmic history) concerning which the two disciplines offer complementary insights. It involves also an engagement with habits of thought which are natural in a culture greatly influenced by the success of science. To take this stance is not to submit to slavery to the spirit of the age, but simply to acknowledge that we view things from where we stand, with all the opportunities and limitations inherent in that particular perspective. . . . My concern is to explore to what extent we can use the search for motivated understanding, so congenial to the scientific mind, as a route to being able to make the substance of Christian orthodoxy our own. Of course, there are some revisions called for in the process, but I do not find that a trinitarian and incarnational theology needs to be abandoned in favour of a toned-down theology of a Cosmic Mind and an inspired teacher, alleged to be more accessible to the modern mind. A scientist expects a fundamental theory to be tough, surprising and exciting. &#34;Throughout, my aim will be to seek an understanding based on a careful assessment of phenomena as the guide to reality. Just as I cannot regard science as merely an instrumentally successful manner of speaking which serves to get things done, so I cannot regard theology as merely concerned with a collection of stories which motivate an attitude to life. It must have its anchorage in the way things actually are, and the way they happen. . . . A bottom-up thinker is bound to ask, What makes you think this story is a verisimilitudinous account of Reality? The anchorage of Christianity in history is to be welcomed, despite its hazards. For me, the Bible is neither an inerrant account of propositional truth nor a compendium of timeless symbols, but a historically conditioned account of certain significant encounters and experiences. Read in that way, I believe it can provide the basis for a Christian belief with is certainly revised in the light of our twentieth-century insights but which is recognizably contained within an envelope of understanding in continuity with the developing doctrine of the Church throughout the centuries.&#34; - from the introduction</p><p>This highly practical step-by-step look at the life and role of the pastor is helpful for newly ordained clergy as well as the experienced pastors looking for guidance, practical wisdom, and renewal.

The book benefits tremendously from the author's meeting with Olivia de Havilland after he was assigned to handle her projected memoir at the Delacorte Press in 1973. Amburn also knew many of the key figures in her life and career, a veritable pantheon of Hollywood royalty from the 30s, 40s, and 50s: Jimmy Stewart, George Cukor, and David O. Selznick, and he was an editor at William Morrow when the company published the autobiography of de Havilland's difficult sister Joan Fontaine.<br>Superbly researched and full of delicious anecdotes about Clark Gable, John Huston, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Montgomery Clift, Errol Flynn, David Niven, and Bette Davis--particularly the bloody, bone-crunching fistfight Flynn and Huston waged over Olivia--this book not only profiles one of the finest actresses of her time, but also the culture of the film industry's Golden Age.<br>It details de Havilland's relationships with the men who sought her--Howard Hughes, Jimmy Stewart, Errol Flynn, John F. Kennedy, Burgess Meredith, and John Huston, as well as her friendships with Grace Kelly, British Prime Minister Edward Heath, Ronald Reagan, Victor Fleming, and Ingrid Bergman.<br>Here, too, are the fabulous and often surprising back stories of her 49 films, including Gone With the Wind, The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Snake Pit, Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte, and the two for which she won Oscars, The Heiress and To Each His Own. The account of the filming of Gone With the Wind is unique in that the author interviewed many of the people involved in the epic making of this masterpiece as Lois Dwight Cole, who discovered the novel, producer David O. Selznick, director George Cukor, agents Kay Brown and Annie Laurie Williams, Radie Harris, Vivien Leigh's closest friend in the press, and both Edie Goetz and Irene Mayer Selznick, daughters of Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, the studio that funded, released, and ended up owning Gone With the Wind.<br>Also included in this biography are Olivia's adventures with Bette Davis. They appeared together in four movies and Davis tried to destroy her, but Olivia stood up to Davis as no other actress had ever dared to do. She won Davis's respect, and by the time they made their biggest hit, Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte, a lasting friendship had blossomed. Undertaking a joint national publicity tour, they attracted mobs of boisterous fans and, in private, reminisced about the Golden Age of movies, evaluated the current crop of stars, and exchanged observations about love goddesses, nudity, and parenthood.</p><p>A 1954 graduate of Texas Christian University, Ellis Amburn worked as a reporter for Newsweek before going into the book publishing industry where, he rose to the position of editor, working for such well-known publishers as Delacorte Press, Coward-McCann, and William Morrow.

THE GODDESS AND THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERIES THE PATH OF THE GODDESS THE GODDESS PATH The Secret Forms of the Goddess and the Rituals of Resurrection The Supreme Being may be worshipped as father or as mother. Ushet Rekhat or Mother Worship, is the spiritual process of worshipping the Divine in the form of the Divine Goddess. It celebrates the most important forms of the Goddess including Nathor, Maat, Aset, Arat, Amentet and Hathor and explores their mystical meaning as well as the rising of Sirius, the star of Aset (Aset) and the new birth of Hor (Heru). The end of the year is a time of reckoning, reflection and engendering a new or renewed positive movement toward attaining spiritual Enlightenment. The Mother Worship devotional meditation ritual, performed on five days during the month of December and on New Year&#39;s Eve, is based on the Ushet Rekhit. During the ceremony, the cosmic forces, symbolized by Sirius - and the constellation of Orion ---, are harnessed through the understanding and devotional attitude of the participant. This propitiation draws the light of wisdom and health to all those who share in the ritual, leading to prosperity and wisdom.</p><p></p><h2>Sunk in Kula Gulf: The Final Voyage of the USS Helena and the Incredible Story of Her Survivors in World War II</h2><p>The early morning hours of July 6, 1943, found the USS <i>Helena</i> off the Solomon Islands in what would later be known as the Battle of Kula Gulf. But the ship&#x2019;s participation in the battle came to a swift end when three Japanese torpedoes suddenly struck. One hundred and sixty-eight sailors went down with the ship, many never surviving the initial torpedo hits. As the last of the <i>Helena</i> disappeared below the ocean&#x2019;s surface, the remaining crewmen&#x2019;s struggle for survival had only just begun.<i>Sunk in Kula Gulf</i> tells the epic story of the <i>Helena</i>&#x2019;s survivors. Two destroyers plucked more than seven hundred from the sea in a night rescue operation as the battle continued to rage. A second group of eighty-eight sailors &#x2015;clustered into three lifeboats&#x2015;made it to a nearby island and was rescued the next day. A third group of survivors, spread over a wide area, was missed entirely. Clinging to life rafts or debris, the weary men were pushed away from the area of the sinking by a strong current. After enduring days at sea under the hot tropical sun, they finally found land. It was, however, the Japanese-held island of Vella Lavella and deep behind the front lines. The survivors organized and disappeared into the island&#x2019;s interior jungle. Living a meager existence, the group evaded the Japanese for eight days until the Marines and U.S. Navy evacuated the shipwrecked sailors in a daring rescue operation. Using a wide variety of sources, including previously unpublished firsthand accounts, John J. Domagalski brings to life this amazing, little-known story from World War II.</p><p>John J.

He certainly tempts that fate again in <i>A Question of Blood</i>, which finds him and his younger partner, Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke, trying to close the case of a withdrawn ex-soldier named Lee Herdman, who apparently shot three teenage boys at a Scottish private school, leaving two of them dead, before turning the pistol on himself.<p> "There&#x2019;s no mystery," Siobhan insists at the start of this 14th Rebus novel (following <i>Resurrection Men</i>). "Herdman lost his marbles, that&#x2019;s all." However, the hard-drinking, chain-smoking Rebus, who'd once sought entry into the same elite regiment in which Herdman served (but ultimately cracked under psychological interrogation), thinks there's more motive than mania behind this classroom slaughter. Perhaps something to do with the gunman's role in a 1995 mission to salvage a downed military helicopter, or with Teri Cotter, a 15-year-old "Goth" who broadcasts her bedroom life over the Internet, yet keeps private her relationship with the haunted Herdman. Rebus's doubts about the murder-suicide theory are deepened with the appearance of two tight-lipped army investigators, and by the peculiar behavior of James Bell, the boy who was only wounded during Herdman's firing spree and whose politician father hopes to use that tragedy as ammo in the campaign against widespread gun ownership. But the detective inspector's focus on this inquiry is susceptible to diversion, both by an internal police probe into his role in the burning death of a small-time crook who'd been stalking Siobhan, and by the fact that Rebus--who shies away from any family contacts--was related to one of Herdman&#x2019;s victims.</p><p> Now middle-aged and on the downward slope of his pugnacity (the high point may have come in 1997's <i>Black and Blue</i>), Rebus has become the engine of his own obsolescence. Overexposure to criminals has left him better at understanding them than his colleagues, and he only worsens his career standing by fighting other people's battles for them, especially Siobhan, who risks learning too many lessons from her mentor. To watch Rebus subvert police conventions and fend of personal demons (that latter struggle mirrored in <i>A Question of Blood</i> by Herdman's own) is worth the admission to this consistently ambitious series. <i>--J.

(What Do We Believe?)</h2><p>Druidism evolved out of the tribal cultures of Britain, Ireland, and western France&nbsp;more than 2,000&nbsp;years ago. In the 17th century it experienced a revival, which has continued to this day. Contemporary Druids can now be found all over the world, and Druidry&#x2019;s appeal lies in its focus on a reverence for the natural world and its&nbsp;belief in the value of personal creativity, and of developing a sense of communion with the powers of nature and the spirit. Druidry&#x2019;s startling recent growth lies in its broad appeal: some treat it as a philosophy, others as a religion, still others as a path of self-development.

However, the practical aspects of how to use precious stones to promote spiritual development have been lost to all but a few initiates. In <i>Steps on the Stone Path,</i> Robert Sardello offers strategies and rituals for recapturing that lost power. <br><br>Sardello starts with guided meditations and rituals for developing awareness of, and the ability to experience, stone qualities such as deep silence, form, transparency, and color as modes of spiritual consciousness. Entering these modes of silent, creative consciousness requires befriending the elemental angelic beings embodied in stones. The author develops these initial practices into a sensory yoga of stones, in which the connection between the self and the Divine Self manifests through the medium of stone-awareness. He encourages us to wear certain gems or to keep specific crystals close to the body, allowing us to enter the world of spirit. <br><br><i>Steps on the Stone Path</i> explores the possibility of uniting our soul being with the soul of specific stones and reveals unknown inner qualities and dimensions of humankind, presenting a dazzling theory of stones as critical tools in the making of a New Heaven and a New Earth.</p><p><b>Robert Sardello,</b> PhD, is cofounder (with Cheryl Sanders-Sardello, PhD, in 1992) of the School of Spiritual Psychology.

However well intentioned, Sirolli points out, inappropriate development often creates more problems than it solves.</p><p>Thus was the genesis of this exciting and unique alternative to traditional economic development termed "Enterprise Facilitation"- where depressed communities can build hope and prosperity by first helping individuals to recognize their talents and business passion, and then providing the skills to transform their dreams into meaningful and rewarding work.</p></p><h2>The Crime of Sheila McGough</h2><p>"[N]o other writer tells better stories about the perpetual, the unwinnable, battle between narrative and truth." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br><b>The Crime of Sheila McGough</b> is Janet Malcolm's brilliant expos� of miscarriage of justice in the case of Sheila McGough, a disbarred lawyer recently released from prison. McGough had served 2 1/2 years for collaborating with a client in his fraud, but insisted that she didn't commit any of the 14 felonies she was convicted.<br><br>An astonishingly persuasive condemnation of the cupidity of American law and its preference for convincing narrative rather than the truth, this is also a story with an unconventional heroine. McGough is a zealous defense lawyer duped by a white-collar con man; a woman who lives, at the age of 54, with her parents; a journalistic subject who frustrates her interviewer with her maddening literal-mindedness. Spirited, illuminating, delightfully detailed, <b>The Crime of Sheila McGough</b> is both a dazzling work of journalism and a searching meditation on character and the law.</p><p>The inimitable Janet Malcolm has previously probed the soft white underbellies of psychiatry, journalism, literary biography, and a half-dozen other disciplines. In <i>The Crime of Sheila McGough</i>, she takes on the legal profession. At first glance this may seem like a ludicrously easy target: who doesn't have his doubts about the vast army of ambulance chasers, shysters, and corporate sharks? But as always, Malcolm has more complicated fish to fry. What fascinates her about the legal system is the endless, agonizing clash of contending narratives. "The transcripts of trials at law--even of routine criminal prosecutions and tiresome civil disputes--are exciting to read," she notes. "They record contests of wit and will that have the stylized structure and dire aura of duels before dawn."<p> To prove her point, Malcolm has chosen one particular prosecution--or, as the facts seem to indicate, persecution. In 1986 a Virginia attorney named Sheila McGough took on the case of a con artist named Bob Bailes. First she defended this charming chiseler against a charge of bank fraud, and lost; then, two years later, she went to bat for him when he was indicted for a bizarre, insurance-related bunco game. Again she lost, and Bailes--whose tale-spinning amounted to a kind of artistry--remained in the slammer. At this point, most advocates would have moved on. Not McGough: "After her client went to prison, she continued defending him as if nothing had happened.... She remained at his side and fought for him as if he were Alfred Dreyfus, instead of the small-time con man, with an unfortunate medical history and an interesting imagination, that he was." Nothing, it turns out, clogs the machinery of the judicial system more thoroughly than an honest--okay, <i>pathologically</i> honest--attorney.</p><p> As McGough continued to fight for her client, she aroused the wrath, and eventually the suspicion, of the court. Surely this nutty crusade must have some hidden agenda. Malcolm makes a strong argument for her subject's innocence: "Veracity was her defining characteristic, like the color of an orange. Her behavior may have been odd, deviant, maddening, but her devotion to the truth--almost like a disease in its helpless literalness--was an inspiriting given." The court, however, thought otherwise. In 1990 McGough was found guilty of 14 counts of felony (most of which made her an accessory to Bailes's depredations) and sentenced to 3 years in prison. Only after her release in 1996 did she enlist the author on her behalf. Unlike previous objects of Malcolm's scrutiny, McGough made little effort to finesse the narrative. All the more remarkable, then, that the most sublime cross-examiner in American letters found her innocent.</p><p> <i>The Crime of Sheila McGough</i> is, needless to say, a stinging critique of the legal system. "Without the thinner of common sense," the author insists, "the law is a toxic substance." (Malcolm, who's gotten a liberal serving of legal toxins during the 1980s and 1990s, is surely speaking from experience.) Yet her book is an equally brilliant brief on human behavior (and misbehavior). And as she plunges deeper into the legal labyrinth, her quest for the truth and nothing but the truth leads her to some superb insights about that <i>other</i> form of imaginative advocacy--writing. "The truth," she offers, "does not make a good story; that's why we have art." But in <i>The Crime of Sheila McGough</i>, Malcolm has it both ways. Deliciously witty and almost supernaturally aware, her book is a true crime story in <i>every</i> sense of the phrase. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><br>"No other writer tells better stories about the perpetual, the unwinnable, battle between narrative &amp; truth...She has again and again returned to one theme: the vexed relationship between the objective truth and the narrative truth we impose on it. Stories--those told by journalists and biographers, lawyers and witnesses--are always a violation of objective truth,even if they contain no overt lies. And yet we are dependent on them...The betrayals &amp; losses inherent in the imposition of narrative--and the power struggles over who will impose it--are Malcolm's great subject, her wellspring."--Margaret Talbot, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><p>"Janet Malcolm is the most morally illuminating literary journalist in the country,and <i>The Crime of Sheila McGough</i>, which I devoured in one sitting, epitomized the qualities I find so exciting in everything she writes. So much of Malcolm's work is a meditation on the unruliness of truth and its struggle against the neatly organized, tendentious stories with which unreliable narrators--biographers, prosecuters, defense lawyers, photographers, and psychoanalysts--try unsucessfully to contain it...In the McGough book, [Malcolm gives us] a breathtaking series of insights on the peculiarly treacherous nature of legal narrative."--Jeffrey Rosen, <i>Slate</i></p><p>"A beautifully written and tautly argued meditation-provocation on the law."<br>--Daniel Max, <i>Miami Herald</i> and <i>New York Observer</i></p></p><h2>Now What?: A Handbook for Families with Transgender Children</h2><p>Are you looking for answers of how to respond to your transgender child?

This predispostion inclines women to worry more than men about things like social problems, work, finances-even about worry itself, a phenomenon psychologists call meta-worry. The goal of this book is to help readers control excessive worry by learning to perceive threats more accurately and to stop focusing on things that are unlikely to happen.</p><p>Following an introduction by noted psychologist Michelle Craske that explores the reasons women worry more than men, the book addresses the fundamentals of worry: what it is, how it differs from anxiety, and how it can develop into a chronic state of mind. The book offers strategies for overcoming worry that include monitoring personal worry triggers, breaking worry-provoking habits, and avoiding avoidance-a major aggravating factor for all anxiety disorders. From it, you'll learn to use mindfulness techniques to avoid ruminating on the past or the future and how to use progressive relaxation to cope with worrisome situations. </p></p><p>An anxiety expert offers women simple and effective cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based strategies for dealing with excessive worry, freeing them to lead more productive, less stressful lives.Holly Hazlett-Stevens, PhD, is assistant professor of psychology at the University of Nevada in Reno, NV.

The mind is the King of &#x201c;conscious&#x201d; reality and specializes in the logical, verbal, archetypal &#x201c;masculine&#x201d; realm of visible information, matter, analysis, clock time, science, technology, reasoned principles, ideology, judgments, the parsing of things into their individual components, and an emphasis on separateness and differences. But the heart is the Queen of &#x201c;unconscious&#x201d; reality and specializes in the intuitive, nonverbal, archetypal &#x201c;feminine&#x201d; realm of spirit, nature, darkness, mystery, dreams, poetry, the relationships between things, and our connectedness to all life. The mind <i>thinks</i>, but it cannot perceive mystery, or unconscious reality. The heart <i>feels</i>, but it cannot speak in words or be dispassionate and &#x201c;logical.&#x201d; <br><br>Of these two available ways of perceiving our environment the conscious mind completely dominates our modern approach to healing, life navigation, and decision making. The problem is not that we use our rational minds so well, or fail to value its achievements in modern science, technology, and civilization. The problem is that we don&#x2019;t equally value and use the heart. So when our rational approaches fail, or even cause us harm, instead of consulting the heart, with its entirely different realm of experience and information, we go back to the failed approach and repeat the same plays from the same playbook of reason. We seek a &#x201c;bigger hammer&#x201d;: more data, more research, more words, a stronger medication, a different technology, another scripture verse. <br><br>At no point do we stop and ask the huge missing questions that dwell in the archetypally feminine realm of the body, soul, spirit, and earth itself: Who am I? What am I doing here on this earth, really? What is my place in the world beyond my job, possessions, favorite sports team, and social network? <br><br>We don&#x2019;t ask those questions because we don&#x2019;t have a social, economic, political, or religious system that honors the heart, the wisdom of the body, or balance with nature. <br><br><b>Heart Communication 101</b> <br><br>In order to get clear on your spiritual center, you need to be able to perceive the subtle communications from your heart on a moment-by-moment basis. In their simplest form, these communications can feel like the three colors of a traffic light: a green (yes/move forward) signal; a red (no/stop this course) signal; and a yellow (caution/slow down/wait) signal. Like a traffic light, these three basic tones change constantly. Each signal can be physically felt in the body and is experienced as: <br><br>� A pleasant attraction or invitation (green light/yes) <br><br>� An unpleasant sense of repulsion or a feeling of disinterest (red light/no) <br><br>� An unclear hesitancy (yellow light/not yet) <br><br>To better illustrate these basic heart communications, here is an exercise to help you experience them as they shift back and forth, &#x201c;as the light changes.&#x201d; You will be sensing these differently felt tones, not thinking about them conceptually, through shifts in feeling, bodily sensation, imagery, emotion, and intuition. <br><br><b>Exercise <br><br>Experiencing the Heart&#x2019;s &#x201c;Navigational Guidance System&#x201d;</b> <br><br>1. Sit comfortably on a chair with both feet on the ground. Take three deep breaths, exhaling slowly through mouth. Close your eyes. <br><br>2. Imagine a person you love to be with. Picture that person in front of you. Imagine their clothing, posture, facial expression, eyes, and mannerisms. <br><br>3. Holding that person&#x2019;s image in front of you, draw your attention to your chest and belly area. Notice what you are experiencing there physically. Scan your body for subtle sensations and pay attention to where in your body you are feeling them. Take your time. Notice your breathing and inner feelings. <br><br>4. Take three deep breaths and clear the image of that person. <br><br>5. Now picture a real person you can hardly stand to be with; a person who may have hurt you or caused pain. Picture that person right in front of you. As before, clearly note their clothing, facial expression, mannerisms, and eyes. Now do the same body scan of yourself and notice what you are experiencing physically, in your body, especially in the chest and gut area. Take your time. Notice your breathing, and the area around your heart. Note anything different from what you sensed with the first person.<br><br>6. Take three deep breaths and clear your imagination completely of this person. <br><br>7. Now for a second time, imagine the person you love to be with back in front of you. Smile. See them smile. Again, do the body scan of your physical, felt response to the presence of this person in front of you. Notice the differences and where you are feeling these differences in your body. <br><br>8. Clear your imagination, and repeat with the unpleasant person. <br><br>9. Return now a final time to the person you love to be with. Enjoy that felt sense. <br><br>10. Open your eyes. Take a few minutes to write down what shifts you felt in your body between each person, and where you felt those shifts in your body. <br><br>The shifting physical sensations you experienced in the exercise above are the dynamic <i>feeling tones</i> of your heart. Feeling tones are the nonverbal language of the heart--and of spirit itself--experienced through your physical body. When honored (carefully explored and skillfully interpreted) they can help you navigate complex life situations as reliably as a compass or GPS unit. Should you take this job? Marry this person? Move to a different state? Your heart knows the answer, and its navigational guidance system is locked on to your unique destiny, and no one else&#x2019;s. When ignored (as I ignored my own persistent body signals in law school) unfortunate things will happen and continue to happen, just as when you ignore the colors of a traffic light.</p><h2>The Earl in My Bed: A Forgotten Princesses Valentine Novella (A Forgotten Princesses Novella)</h2><p><p><em>The Earl in My Bed</em>, a Valentine novella from <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Sophie Jordan, is a lively, sexy historical romance that bridges <em>Lessons from a Scandalous Bride</em> and the final installment of the popular Forgotten Princesses series.<br>&nbsp;<br>All her life, everyone assumed Paget Ellsworth, the vicar&#x2019;s daughter, would marry the Earl of Winningham's youngest son.

In his two-volume work on the doctrine of justification, Michael Horton seeks not simply to repeat noble doctrinal formulas and traditional proof texts, but to encounter the remarkable biblical justification texts in conversation with the provocative proposals that, despite a wide range of differences, have reignited the contemporary debates around justification.</p><p>Volume 1 engages in a descriptive task - an exercise in historical theology exploring the doctrine of justification from the patristic era to the Reformation. Broadening the scope, Horton explores patristic discussions of justification under the rubric of the "great exchange." He provides a map for contemporary discussions of justification, identifying and engaging his principal interlocutors: Origen, Chrysostom, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Gabriel Biel, and the magisterial reformers. Observing the assimilation of justification to the doctrine of penance in medieval theology, especially via Peter Lombard, the work studies the transformations of the doctrine through Aquinas, Scotus and the nominalists leading up to the era of the Reformation and the Council of Trent. He concludes his first study by examining the hermeneutical and theological significance of the Reformers&#x2019; understanding of the law and the gospel and the resultant covenantal scheme that became formative in Reformed theology. This then opens the door to the constructive task of volume 2 - to investigate the biblical doctrine of justification in light of contemporary exegesis.</p><p>&#x201c;This thorough, systematic, and far-ranging work advances a reading both distinctive and yet more traditional than many of today&#x2019;s dominant paradigms.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>CRAIG KEENER</strong>, Asbury Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Protestant and Catholic readers . . . will profit by wrestling with this learned historical study.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>GERALD R.

More than 50 years later, The Smurfs continue to delight us all with their silliness, bravery, heroism, and heart, and now we finally have a definitive collection of Peyo's original comics to see where it all began. </p><p>Newly remastered and presented in original publication order, along with a Smurfy collection of historical notes and photographs, this volume introduces us to Smurfette and features a "Johan and Peewit" story never before seen in the U.S.</p></p><p>Peyo created The Smurfs in his comic strip &#34;Johan and Peewit.&#34; Peyo wrote and drew several extremely popular comic series in Europe throughout his storied career. In 2008 the country of Belgium celebrated the 50th Anniversary of The Smurfs by issuing a 5 Euro coin featuring his beloved creation.The second Papercutz anthology of original Smurf stories offers a delightful and instructive mix of Peyo&#x2019;s colorful tales. A series of essays interspersed throughout the collection provides social and historical context for the cartoons, particularly with regard to Smurfette, who was originally created as a destructive weapon foisted on the all-male Smurf village, reflecting period chauvinism. Other tales here feature the hilarity of Vanity Smurf creating a mirror image of himself, complete with identical reversed speech bubbles, in The Hundredth Smurf; and one of Peyo&#x2019;s Johan and Pirlouit adventures, The War of Seven Fountains, in which the Smurfs are merely an interlude, just as they appeared during the series&#x2019; initial publication. As with other reprints of midcentury comics, some may bristle at the thought of young readers encountering the antiquated politics representative of the period, but that&#x2019;s all the more reason for adults to give in to their nostalgia for the whimsical Smurfs and share this collection with kids. Peyo, whose charming Benny Breakiron stories are also being reintroduced, certainly continues to deserve a readership.

Growing up during the Great Depression and building airplanes and houses during WWII little prepared Chuck for his first trip to Paris in 1953. There, he fell in love with something most Americans had never seen before: professional-caliber French cookware. Within a few years, he acquired a hardware store in the California wine country and started selling a few saut� pans, souffl� dishes, and brioche tins. What followed is history, as Williams-Sonoma has grown to become the leading cookware retailer in America. Readers will be surprised and delighted to discover the inimitable personality behind it all, whose love of good food, passion for customer service, and legendary good taste helped transform the American kitchen.</p><p>A lifelong passion for good food led Chuck Williams (San Francisco, CA) to open the first Williams-Sonoma store in the California wine country in 1956. Since then, he has devoted much of his time to encouraging people to explore the world of cooking. Over the years he has steadily sought out new techniques, equipment, and ingredients to feature in his stores, catalog, and cookbooks, with the mission of spreading the pleasures of cooking at home. Now more than 250 Williams-Sonoma stores are open across the United States, and Chuck is widely recognized as a pioneer who revolutionized cooking in America.</p><h2>Music for Children: Orff-Schulwerk American Edition Volume 3, Upper Elementary</h2><p>(Schott). Carl Orff devoted much of his life to music for children. His pioneering work continues under the guidance of teachers and educators in many countries. The five basic German volumes of &#34;Music for Children&#34; by Carl Orff and Gunild Keetman were published between 1950 and 1954. The considerable growth of Orff-Schulwerk in the United States led to the publication of the American Edition (1977) to satisfy the requirements of a different educational system and national heritage. Music for Children is a stimulating source of material for music teaching. The American Edition assembles works by all the leading contributors to the Orff movement. In three volumes, the techniques of &#34;knowing&#34; and &#34;doing&#34; are used to teach music through rhythm, melody, texture, and form. It&#39;s an unbeatable resource for music teachers!

From the Library and Lighthouse of Alexandria to the Great Pyramid at Giza, the Ancient Egyptians produced several wonders of the world, revolutionized architecture and construction, created some of the world&#x2019;s first systems of mathematics and medicine, and established language and art that spread across the known world. With world-famous leaders like King Tut and Cleopatra, it&#x2019;s no wonder that today&#x2019;s world has so many Egyptologists. <br>In ancient Egypt, cities held political and religious significance, which meant that if the political or religious tides changed, so too could the fortunes of particular cities. Memphis is perhaps the best known of ancient Egypt&#x2019;s cities because it was fortunate enough to be the political capital of the Egyptian state for most of its history. Hundreds of miles to Memphis&#x2019; south, Thebes became an important city during the Middle Kingdom and its stature grew during the New Kingdom when many of the pharaohs came from there and the national god, Amun, had its cult center in the city. Others cities, such as Tanis and Sais, were important for much shorter periods in Egyptian history. The city of Abju, which was known as Abydus to the Greeks, and later became known simply as &#x201c;Abydos&#x201d; had a history that was as long as Memphis&#x2019;, and although its influence on pharaonic culture may not have been as apparent, it was no less profound.<br>The city of Abydos was the most important political city in ancient Egypt&#x2019;s &#x201c;Archaic&#x201d; or Early Dynastic Period, which encompassed the first two dynasties of Egyptian history (ca. 3100-2650 BC). All of the kings of the First Dynasty and two of the kings of the Second Dynasty are believed to have resided in the nearby, but as of yet unlocated, city of Thinis and were buried in the necropolis of Abydos, making it one of the holiest sites in early pharaonic history. After the Archaic Period, Abydos lost much of its political influence to Memphis, Thebes, and other cities, but retained its significance by becoming an important religious center. Beginning in the Old Kingdom (ca. 2686-2181 BC), the first major temples were built near the city, attracting priests and pilgrims alike, but it was in the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2055-1650 BC) when Abydos became the center of the Osiris cult. As the importance and popularity of Osiris grew throughout Egypt, so too did the city. Several kings in the New Kingdom (ca. 1550-1069 BC) and Late Period built mortuary temples to their own cults and added to the existing monuments to Osiris in order to ensure their immortality and to prove their piousness to their people. Eventually, though, when the Greeks took control of Egypt, the importance of Abydos waned and so too did its size.<br>Abydos: The History and Legacy of the Ancient Egyptian Holy City and Burial Site examines the history of the city, and what life and death were like there. Along with pictures depicting important people, places, and events, you will learn about Abydos like never before.</p><p></p><h2>A Farmgirl&#39;s Table</h2><p><p><i>From a farmgirl&#x2019;s table to yours.</i></p> <p>The New England farmgirl, transplanted to North Carolina, shares heartwarming stories and personal advice along with a bushel of new recipes for using produce from the garden or farmers market, stocking a pantry with canned goods, making homemade bread and traditional family recipes, and entertaining guests at get-togethers with recipes for lemonades and drinks, salads, hearty main courses, pies, cakes, and more.</p> <p>Author of <i>The New England Farmgirl,</i> <b>Jessica Robinson</b> was raised on a small Connecticut farm where her family raised livestock and grew crops, as well as operated a maple sugar house.

With its reputation as a shadowy land of easy vice and hard virtue, San Francisco provided the ideal setting for many of the greatest films noir, from classics like <i>The Maltese Falcon</i> and <i>Dark Passage</i> to obscure treasures like <i>Woman on the Run</i> and <i>D.O.A.</i>, and neo-noirs like <i>Point Blank</i> and<i> The Conversation</i>. Readers visit the Mission Dolores cemetery where James Stewart spied Kim Novak visiting Carlotta's grave in <i>Vertigo</i>; the Steinhart Aquarium, where a steamy love scene unfolded between Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth in <i>The Lady from Shanghai</i>; and the Kezar Stadium, where Clint Eastwood captures the serial killer, Scorpio, in a blaze of ghastly white light in <i>Dirty Harry</i>. In this guide to the great films noir and the locations where they were shot, the mythic noir city meets San Francisco's own dark past.

It was from other field hands that she first heard about the Underground Railroad which she travelled by herself north to Philadelphia. Throughout her long life (she died at the age of ninety-two) and long after the Civil War brought an end to slavery, this amazing woman was proof of what just one person can do.</p><p>Yona Zeldis McDonough is a longtime doll lover and collector.

It may have been 1820 or 1821. Almost everyone thought the birth of a slave baby wasn&#x2019;t worth remembering. Born a slave, Harriet Tubman grew into a brave and daring young woman. She was brave enough to escape from slavery. She was daring enough to help others escape, too. Because she led so many to freedom, she was called &#x201c;Moses.&#x201d; Like Moses in the Bible, Harriet Tubman believed that her people should be free. And she risked her life many times to help them become free. Even after she had escaped safely from the South, she went back to take other slaves north to freedom. Here is her story.</p><p>Chapter 1<br>Life in Maryland</p><p>Sometime around 1820 in Maryland, a slave named Harriet Ross had a baby girl. Neither Harriet, who was called Old Rit, nor her husband, Ben, could read or write, so they couldn&#x2019;t record the year of the baby&#x2019;s birth. No one else thought it was worth doing. But Old Rit loved her tiny child and wanted to protect her. She hoped her little girl, whose nickname was Minty, would learn to sew, cook, or weave. Then she could be a house slave and avoid the backbreaking work picking crops like tobacco, corn, or wheat in the fields.</p></p><h2>Japan and the Culture of the Four Seasons: Nature, Literature, and the Arts</h2><p>Elegant representations of nature and the four seasons populate a wide range of Japanese genres and media&#x2015;from poetry and screen painting to tea ceremonies, flower arrangements, and annual observances. In Japan and the <i>Culture of the Four Seasons</i>, Haruo Shirane shows how, when, and why this practice developed and explicates the richly encoded social, religious, and political meanings of this imagery. <br><br>Refuting the belief that this tradition reflects Japan's agrarian origins and supposedly mild climate, Shirane traces the establishment of seasonal topics to the poetry composed by the urban nobility in the eighth century. After becoming highly codified and influencing visual arts in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the seasonal topics and their cultural associations evolved and spread to other genres, eventually settling in the popular culture of the early modern period. Contrasted with the elegant images of nature derived from court poetry was the agrarian view of nature based on rural life. The two landscapes began to intersect in the medieval period, creating a complex, layered web of competing associations. Shirane discusses a wide array of representations of nature and the four seasons in many genres, originating in both the urban and rural perspective: textual (poetry, chronicles, tales), cultivated (gardens, flower arrangement), material (kimonos, screens), performative (noh, festivals), and gastronomic (tea ceremony, food rituals). He reveals how this kind of "secondary nature," which flourished in Japan's urban architecture and gardens, fostered and idealized a sense of harmony with the natural world just at the moment it was disappearing. <br><br>Illuminating the deeper meaning behind Japanese aesthetics and artifacts, Shirane clarifies the use of natural images and seasonal topics and the changes in their cultural associations and function across history, genre, and community over more than a millennium. In this fascinating book, the four seasons are revealed to be as much a cultural construction as a reflection of the physical world.</p><p>Elegant representations of nature and the four seasons populate a wide range of Japanese genres and media.

By marrying the explanation of a film theory with the interpretation of a film, the volumes provide discrete examples of how film theory can serve as the basis for textual analysis. <i>Feminist Film Theory and </i>Cl�o from 5 to 7 offers a concise introduction to feminist film theory in jargon-free language and shows how this theory can be deployed to interpret Agnes Varda's critically acclaimed 1962 film <i>Cl�o from 5 to 7.</i><br><br>Hilary Neroni employs the methodology of looking for a feminist alternative among female-oriented films. Through three key concepts-identification, framing the woman's body, and the female auteur-Neroni lays bare the debates and approaches within the vibrant history of feminist film theory, providing a point of entry to feminist film theory from its inception to today. Picking up one of the currents in feminist film theory - that of looking for feminist alternatives among female-oriented films - Neroni traces feminist responses to the contradictions inherent in most representations of women in film, and she details how their responses have intervened in changing what we see on the screen.</p><p><b>Hilary Neroni</b> is Professor of Film and Television Studies at the University of Vermont, USA.

Language is our constant companion throughout our lifetime, even as we age. Indeed, compared with other aspects of cognition, language seems to be fairly resilient through the process of aging. In <i>Changing Minds</i>, Roger Kreuz and Richard Roberts examine how aging affects language&#x2015;and how language affects aging. </p><p>Kreuz and Roberts report that what appear to be changes in an older person's language ability are actually produced by declines in such other cognitive processes as memory and perception. Some language abilities, including vocabulary size and writing ability, may even improve with age. And certain language activities&#x2015;including reading fiction and engaging in conversation&#x2015;may even help us live fuller and healthier lives.</p><p>Kreuz and Roberts explain the cognitive processes underlying our language ability, exploring in particular how changes in these processes lead to changes in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. They consider, among other things, the inability to produce a word that's on the tip of your tongue&#x2015;and suggest that the increasing incidence of this with age may be the result of a surfeit of world knowledge. For example, older people can be better storytellers, and (something to remember at a family reunion) their perceived tendency toward off-topic verbosity may actually reflect communicative goals.</p></p><p>Roger Kreuz is Associate Dean and Director of Graduate Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences and Professor of Psychology at the University of Memphis.

In April 1974 he was three months away from completing his residency when he was indicted on a charge of manslaughter by a secret Grand Jury. The indictment concerned an abortion he had performed on a 17-year old girl, and the alleged victim washer aborted fetus. The indictment was sought by an over zealous, anti-abortion prosecutor and because of the racial, political and religious climate which existed in Boston the indictment received national and international attention. In January of 1975 his sensational six week trial began before a jury which was all white, predominantly male and overwhelmingly Catholic. The dynamic confluences of race, sex and revenge played out in a Boston courtroom. The book reveals, for the first time, the maneuverings and conflicts which went on behind the scenes during the time leading up to the trial and during the trial itself. The bitter determination of the prosecuting attorney to impose his personal religious views as the law of the land provides important lessons as we struggle to reach a new social compact for the 21st Century; equal rights for people of both sexes and all races remains central to our national debate. The Supreme Court has recently handed down a landmark decision, intervening in the abortion debate to decree what medical procedure a doctor may or may not use in considering the health and well-being of women seeking legal abortions. The strategy used to get this Supreme Court sanctioned law passed and signedis the same strategy used to indict and try Dr. Edelin more than 30 years ago.For everyone who cares about civil and reproductive rights, this is an important book.</p><p>Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin received his undergraduate education at Columbia University in New York City, and his medical degree from Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. After a tour of duty in the United States Air Force, he received his specialty training in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston City Hospital, and became the first African American to become Chief Resident in the history of the department. Five years after completing his residency, Dr. Edelin became Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), a position he held until1989. He was Associate Dean of Students and Minority Affairs at BUSM from 1989 until his retirement in 2006. Currently he is Emeritus Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston University.From 1989 to 1992 he was the Chairman of the Board of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the largest private family planning agency in the country, with over 900 family planning clinics nationwide.

Yet it quickly becomes clear that the real reason is Ethan; he has experienced a tragic incident involving his best friend Kasey, and his parents think a new place will bring a new start. On top of Ethan's guilt from the accident, he must make new friends at school, deal with his brother Roddie's dissatisfaction with their new home, and witness the arguments between his mother and grandfather, who don't get along for mysterious reasons. This title is packed with conflict and familial and personal strife.

Ethan is a sensitive and lost soul, grappling with the emotions of a typical adolescent boy and the turmoil of a traumatic event. His new friend Coralee is exciting and enticing and the kind of friend any young person might wish for or strive to be. Ethan's grandfather is also an amusing and fascinating character, wise and sympathetic to the struggling Ethan. As the mysteries unfold&#x2014;What was the accident, and how did Kasey get hurt? Who is the mystery woman in the creepy house down the lane? Why don't Grandpa and Ethan's mother get along?&#x2014;there is never a dull moment, and the rapid pace keeps readers engaged.

The circumstances of her life and extraordinary qualities ascribed to her are analyzed in the greater context of spiritual biography and Buddhist doctrine. More than a historical presentation, Niguma's story raises the question of women as real spiritual leaders versus male images of&nbsp; feminine principle and other related contemporary issues. This volume includes the thirteen works that have been attributed to Niguma in the Tibetan Buddhist canon. These collected works form the basis of an ancient lineage Shangpa, which continues to be actively studied and practiced today. These works include the source verses for such esoteric practices as the Six Yogas, the Great Seal, and the Chakrasamvara and Hevajra tantric practices that are widespread in Tibetan traditions. Also included is the only extant biography, which is enhanced by the few other sources of information on her life and work.</p><p>Sarah Harding has been a Tibetan Buddhist translator and practitioner since 1974. She became a student of the late master Kalu Rinpoche, and in 1980, she completed the traditional three-year retreat under his guidance. Since then, she has been a teacher and translator. Her publications include <i>Machik's Complete Explanation</i>, <i>The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Eight,</i> and <i>The Life and Revelations of Pema Lingpa</i>. She is a fellow at the Tsadra Foundation and has been on the faculty of Naropa University for nearly twenty years."Such an important historical female figure as Niguma has been obscured by centuries of overlaid mythology, but now Sarah Harding has skillfully managed to separate the wheat from the chaff and to reveal something of the woman behind the legend, along with her place in the Shangpa tradition and her fascinating writings on Yoga."&#x2014;Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, author of <i>Reflections on a Mountain Lake </i><br> "Sarah Harding's fascinating account of the literature surrounding Niguma, heiress of unimaginable qualities, provides a rare glimpse into the life of a legendary female practitioner who traces the source of her wisdom lineage directly to Vajradhara the epitome of awakening. The collected works and biography are gems of insight into the spiritual journey of this elusive figure whose realization culminates in the perfection of timeless awareness and an illusory rainbow body. Deftly written, the account is a treasure trove of information about tantric practices and attainments focused especially on the nature and power of illusion. Harding's attempts to separate the flesh-and-blood woman from the idealized dakini make for an engaging, often amusing read for neophytes and experienced practitioners alike. Of special relevance to those who happen to be women this time around."&#x2014;Karma Lekshe Tsomo, editor of <i>Buddhism through American Women's Eyes</i></p><h2>Archive Stories: Facts, Fictions, and the Writing of History</h2><p>Despite the importance of archives to the profession of history, there is very little written about actual encounters with them&#x2014;about the effect that the researcher&#x2019;s race, gender, or class may have on her experience within them or about the impact that archival surveillance, architecture, or bureaucracy might have on the histories that are ultimately written. This provocative collection initiates a vital conversation about how archives around the world are constructed, policed, manipulated, and experienced. It challenges the claims to objectivity associated with the traditional archive by telling stories that illuminate its power to shape the narratives that are &#x201c;found&#x201d; there.<p></p><p><i>Archive Stories</i> brings together ethnographies of the archival world, most of which are written by historians. Some contributors recount their own experiences. One offers a moving reflection on how the relative wealth and prestige of Western researchers can gain them entry to collections such as Uzbekistan&#x2019;s newly formed Central State Archive, which severely limits the access of Uzbek researchers. Others explore the genealogies of specific archives, from one of the most influential archival institutions in the modern West, the Archives nationales in Paris, to the significant archives of the Bakunin family in Russia, which were saved largely through the efforts of one family member. Still others explore the impact of current events on the analysis of particular archives. A contributor tells of researching the 1976 Soweto riots in the politically charged atmosphere of the early 1990s, just as apartheid in South Africa was coming to an end. A number of the essays question what counts as an archive&#x2014;and what counts as history&#x2014;as they consider oral histories, cyberspace, fiction, and plans for streets and buildings that were never built, for histories that never materialized.</p><p>Contributors.

The place is rough and quiet; Orren is overworked and withdrawn. Left mostly to her own, Aloma struggles to settle herself in this lonely setting and to find beauty and stimulation where she can.

She was named one of the 5 Best Writers Under 35 by the National Book FoundationShe lives in Kentucky.</p>She had never lived in a house and now, seeing the thing, she was no longer sure she wanted to. It was the right house, she knew it was. It was as he had described. She shielded her eyes as she drove the long slope, her truck jolting and bucking as she approached. The bottomland yawned into view and she saw the fields where the young tobacco faltered on the drybeat earth, the ridge beyond. All around the soil had leached to chalky dust under the sun. She looked for the newer, smaller house that Orren had told her of, but she did not see it, only the old listing structure before her and the fields and the slope of tall grasses that fronted the house. She parked her truck and stared, her tongue troubled the inside of her teeth. The house cast no shadow in the bare noon light.<br><br>The ragged porch clung weakly to the wall of the building, its floorboards lining out from the door, their splintering gray now naked to the elements that first undressed them. When she tested a board with one foot, the wood ached and sounded under her, but did not move. She picked her way around a mudspattered posthole digger and a length of chicken wire to reach the door where she found a paper heart taped to the wood. The shape of the thing gave her pause. She read the note without touching it.<br><br><i>Aloma,<br>If you come when I&#x2019;m gone, the tractor busted and I went to Hansonville for parts. Go on in. I will come back soon,<br>Orren<br><br></i>In this house, she thought, or the new one? She straightened up and hesitated. Over her head a porch fan hung spinless, trailing its cobwebs like old hair, its spiders gone. She turned to peer behind her down the gravel drive. Displaced dust still hung close behind the fender of her truck, loath to lie down in boredom again. It was quiet, both on the buckling blacktop road where not a single car had passed since she&#x2019;d driven up, and here on the porch where the breezeless day was silent. A few midday insects spoke and that was all. She turned around and walked into the house.<br><br>If it was abandoned, it was not empty. Curtains hung bleached to gray and tattered rugs scattered across the floor. Against one wall, nestled under the rise of a staircase and a high landing, stood an old upright piano. One sulling eyebrow rose. Orren had told her of a piano on the property, one she could practice on, but it could not be this. Aloma edged past its sunken frame, leaving it untouched, and walked back through a dining room washed in south light past a table papered with bills and letters, into the kitchen. The ceiling here was high and white. It seemed clean mostly because it was empty &#x2013; spacious and empty as a church. She circled the room, tugged open drawers and cabinets, but her eyes stared at their contents unseeing, her mind wheeling backward. She turned on her heel and stalked to the first room. She tossed back the fallboard and reached her fingers to the ivory. The keys stuttered to the bed, fractionally apart beneath her fingers, and it was no more, no less than she had expected. The sound was spoiled like a meat. She slapped the fallboard down, wood on wood clapped out into the echoing house in cracking waves, and then it was gone. She turned away with the air of someone halfheartedly resigned to endure, but as she turned, she started and stopped. A wall of faces stood before her, photographs in frames armied around a blackened mantel, eyes from floor to ceiling. She studied them without stepping closer. They gazed back.<br><br>She left the room as quick as she had come, retraced her steps to the kitchen where she had spied a door that led outside. She opened it wide to the June day. From where she stood, she claimed a long view of the back property. A field of tobacco began down a slope a hundred yards from the house and a fallow field neighbored close by, its beds risen like new graves. There a black curing barn stood and from its rafters a bit of tobacco hung like browned bird wings, pinions down, too early and out of season, she could not say why. To her left another barn, this one red, with a large gated pen and a gallery on one side. The pasture was empty. The cows had all wandered up a hillside to a stand of brazen green trees and stood blackly on the fringe of its shade gazing out, their bodies in the cloaking dark but their heads shined to a high gloss like black pennies in the sunlight. Far below their unmoving faces the newer house pointed south, no larger than a doublewide, no taller, no prettier. It banked the barbed edge of the cows&#x2019; pasture. But none of this held Aloma&#x2019;s gaze for more than a moment. Instead, she looked out into the distance where, because she could not will them away or otherwise erase them from the earth, the spiny ridges of the mountains stood. She laughed a laugh without humor. All her hopes, and there they were. Had they been any closer, she&#x2019;d have suffered to hear them laughing back.<br>When he came, she saw the sun flashes between the farthest trees where the road ran out of the north and she stepped forward and waited. Her eyes worried the spot where the treeline ended. Then when the truck shot free from the last trees and she knew that it was his, she took another step forward and her hands came together of their own accord, but she did not leave the porch. His truck, as familiar to her as a face, turned in the drive, the glass glinted. Her eyes followed his progress up the hill, the dust rolling and sweeping low to the ground in blond curls behind his truck, then flanging and fading to nothing. At first she could see his figure only as a dark shape and the sun firing on the watch on his right arm as he turned the wheel. Then when he was finally before her, braking and leaning in slightly under the shade of the visor to pull the keys from the ignition, she found the broad contours of his face and the color of his skin, much browner than the last time she had seen him, the day after the funeral three weeks ago when he came down to the school and sat beside her and set a question to her. He said, You&#x2019;ll come up? And she said, Yes, yes. And it don&#x2019;t matter if it&#x2019;s all out of order like it is? And she shook her head and took his blanched face in her hands and kissed him, and that had struck her later as an odd reversal, he usually being the one to reach out and pull her to him. But she&#x2019;d thought of it only later when she recalled how his lips had not made any motion against hers. It aroused a feeling in her like fear, but so slight and quick to fade that she didn&#x2019;t recognize it for what it was. Now she could not take her eyes from him sitting motionless in the truck watching her as she watched him. She stepped off the porch, hesitant at first, but then half running until she was standing at his door, her hand on the burning chrome of the handle. The tips of his eyelashes were pale as straw now, bleached from the sun so it seemed he had no eyelashes at all, nothing to impede his gaze. She yanked open the door of the truck or he pushed it open and she was half sitting in his lap and they were kissing. She said his name. He said nothing against her mouth. When she pulled away, Aloma saw the hatchings around his eyes were deeper than before. He was drawn, even more so than after the funeral she had not attended because she had to accompany the school&#x2019;s choir to Grayson, the principal had not given her the day off, she had her commitments. They were not her people, after all.<br><br>Orren placed his hand on his own chest flat-palmed and she saw the dark line of dirt under his nails like earthen parentheses. He looked at her directly. He said, You been here long?<br><br>No, she said, I only just got here a half hour ago.<br><br>He gave her a little shove then so he could ease up out of the cab, and when he did, she saw there was something altered in his body. Sudden age had impressed itself on his frame. With something like embarrassment, she turned slightly to look elsewhere, but found her eyes unwilling to obey, wary of this new thing, and when he slammed the door and stood before her, they both appeared ill at ease for a moment as if sizing up their differences. Then Orren stepped in to close the space between them and kissed her again and she sought after his familiar tobaccoed breath. He took her hand and said, Come on. You seen the house?<br><br>Which one? she said, her hand pressed a slight resistance onto his.<br><br>The real one, he said and nodded up at the big house.<br><br>Yeah, she said slowly, thought to say something more, but desisted. She let him lead her around the side and she peeked at him as he looked up at the height of it, squinting, his thin lips flattening further. He hitched up the waistband of his jeans and he crossed his arms over his chest and she saw clearly she had been mistaken. He had not turned old in three weeks&#x2019; time, it was as though someone had come along with a plane and sheered off all the extra that once cushioned him. He was like something corded, every movement curtailed. She had noticed this too that first day after the funeral when he stepped from his truck looking pared as a carving and just as stiff, though he&#x2019;d felt the same under her hands when she held him. But there was something different in his carriage &#x2013; he was newly fitted to his skeleton &#x2013; something that she saw now was a lasting change and not just a momentary trick of grief. This new bounded self had banished the old.<br><br>At the rear of the house, Orren steered her down along the rutted path that led to the newer, smaller house. She stepped smart to match his pace, eager to see the inside and maybe show him how much she preferred it to the large and rambling structure behind them. But he stopped abruptly only partway down the path and she stumbled against him and put her hand on his hip to steady herself. Orren raised one arm and pointed out toward the hills.<br><br>It&#x2019;s us all the way to the ridge, right under, he said. From where they stood at the crown of the tobacco field, the whole of the back property spread before them.

Ahern, of Gluten-Free Girl fame.</b><br><br>Like so many American women, Shauna M. Ahern spent decades feeling not good enough about her body, about money, and about her worth in this culture. For a decade, with the help of her husband, she ran a successful food blog, wrote award-winning cookbooks, and raised two children. In the midst of this, at age 48, she suffered a mini-stroke. Tests revealed she would recover fully, but when her doctor impressed upon her that emotional stress can cause physical damage, she dove deep inside herself to understand and let go of a lifetime of damaging patterns of thought. <br><br>With candor and humor, Ahern traces the arc of her life in essays, starting with the feeling of "not good enough" which was sown in a traumatic childhood and dogged her well into adulthood. She writes about finding her rage, which led her to find her enduring motto: enough pretending. And she chronicles how these phases have opened the door to living more joyfully today with mostly enough: friends, family, and her community.<br><br>Readers will be moved by Ahern's brave stories. They will also find themselves in these essays, since we all have to find our own definition of enough.</p><p>SHAUNA M.

The Ninth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje (1556&#x2013;1603) was the acknowledged master of this approach. No more authoritative or useful instructions exist than in his three definitive texts on Mahamudra, of which this easy-to-use manual is the shortest and most practical. <i>Pointing Out the Dharmakaya</i> is an indispensable companion to <i>The Ocean of Definitive Meaning</i>, the most vast and detailed of the texts. An invaluable guide for Mahamudra practitioners on how to look at the mind, it is clearly laid out so that the instructions are easy to recall and put to use. Brilliant explanations by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche make this text vividly relevant for contemporary Western practitioners. For those committed to ascertaining the mind's true nature, checking their experience, and refining and extending their insight, there is no more systematic or comprehensive approach than can be found in this extraordinary set of instructions.</p><p>Khenchen Thrangu was born in Tibet in 1933.

More than ever before, Christians will need to explain why they follow Jesus and not the Buddha or Confucius or Krishna or Muhammed. But if, while relating their faith to the faiths, Christians treat non-Christian religions as netherworlds of unmixed darkness, the church's message will be a scandal not of particularity but of arrogant obscurantism. "Recent evangelical introductions to the problem of other religions have built commendably on foundations laid by J. N. D. Anderson and Stephen Neill. Anderson and Neill opened up the "heathen" worlds to the evangelical West, showing that many non-Christians also seek salvation and have personal relationships with their gods. In the last decade Clark Pinnock and John Sanders have argued for an inclusivist understanding of salvation, and Harold Netland has shed new light on the question of truth in the religions. Yet no evangelicals have focused--as nonevangelicals Keith Ward, Diana Eck and Paul Knitter have done--on the revelatory value of truth in non-Christian religions. Anderson and Neill showed that there are limited convergences between Christian and non-Christian traditions, and Pinnock has argued that there might be truths Christians can learn from religious others. But as far as I know, no evangelicals have yet examined the religions in any sort of substantive way for what Christians can learn without sacrificing, as Knitter and John Hick do, the finality of Christ. "This book is the beginning of an evangelical theology of the religions that addresses not the question of salvation but the problem of truth and revelation, and takes seriously the normative claims of other traditions. It explores the biblical propositions that Jesus is the light that enlightens every person (Jn 1:9) and that God has not left Himself without a witness among non-Christian traditions (Acts 14:17). It argues that if Saint Augustine learned from Neo-Platonism to better understand the gospel, if Thomas Aquinas learned from Aristotle to better understand the Scriptures, and if John Calvin learned from Renaissance humanism, perhaps evangelicals may be able to learn from the Buddha--and other great religious thinkers and traditions--things that can help them more clearly understand God's revelation in Christ. It is an introductory word in a conversation that I hope will go much further among evangelicals." (Gerald McDermott, in the introduction to <em>Can Evangelicals Learn from World Religions?</em>)</p><p>Gerald R. McDermott (PhD, University of Iowa) is Anglican Chair of Divinity at Beeson Divinity School in Birmingham, Alabama. He is also associate pastor at Christ the King Anglican Church.

Leaving aside the issue of the fate of the unevangelized, it leads us to expect to learn from people of other faiths and not suppose that they have nothing to teach us. What a gracious and open spirit this message frees us to have." (Clark H. Pinnock, professor of theology, McMaster Divinity College)<br><br>"Evangelicals have been wary of engaging at any depth with faiths other than Christianity. Commitment to the 'scandal of particularity' has meant that many never consider what the revelatory value of non-Christian religions might be. Gerald McDermott provides a beautifully written, timely and much-needed contribution to a field where most evangelicals fear to tread." (Jeremy Begbie, vice principal, Ridley Hall, University of Cambridge)<br><br>"Can one's Christian faith be enriched by encounter with the <em>Analects</em> of Confucius? Could God's saving deed and disclosure in Jesus Christ alone include a wider grace at work in the wisdom of other world religions? Evangelical Gerald McDermott says yes. With warrants from Scripture and the tradition of Jonathan Edwards, and a good grasp of today's debates on religious pluralism, he makes his case by scrutiny of key writings on non-Christian religions. Here is a fresh voice that needs to be heard in the current conversation."

Shuttled among foster homes as a child, she took a number of low-wage jobs while she determinedly made the connections that landed her in successful Broadway productions. Stanwyck then acted in a stream of high-quality films from the 1930s through the 1950s. Directors such as Cecil B. DeMille, Fritz Lang, and Frank Capra treasured her particular magic.

Beltway insider and stuffy talk show host John Oliver Banion finds his privileged life turned topsy-turvy when he is abducted by aliens from his exclusive country-club golf course. When he is abducted a second time, he believes he has found his true calling and, in the most pasionate crusade of his life, demands that Congress and the White House seriously investigate the existence of extraterrestrials and UFOs.

Way out there.</p></p><p>In Christopher Buckley's hilarious fourth novel, Washington, D.C., is naturally enough a place of sex, lies, and videotape. Unfortunately for <i>Little Green Men</i>'s pundit protagonist, John Oliver Banion, it is also the HQ of Majestic Twelve, a very, very covert government project. Since "that golden Cold War summer of 1947," MJ-12 has had a single mission--to convince taxpayers that space invaders are constantly lurking below what's left of the ozone layer. "A country convinced that little green men were hovering over the rooftops was inclined to vote yea for big weapons and space programs," the author thoughtfully explains.<p> But one disgruntled operative wants out. Nathan Scrubbs is fed up to the back teeth with the art of alien abduction--not to mention his cover as a Social Security flunky--so when his request for a transfer is quashed, he drunkenly decides to take it out on ubiquitous ultra-prig Banion, who happens to be on TV at the time. The ensuing high-tech kidnap, at Maryland's Burning Bush Country Club, is only one of the thousands of convulsively funny scenes in <i>Little Green Men</i>. Not that the novel isn't a skewed morality play of some sort: as Banion comes to believe in Tall Nordics and Short Ugly Grays, he is quickly removed from every A-list in town. But oddly enough, social and political disaster turns out to be as liberating as the finest alien probe. Let's just say that long before Banion and Scrubbs have a close encounter at the Millennium Man March on Washington, this Beltway barrel of monkeys attains a truly extraplanetary level of amusement. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>istopher Buckley published one of the most acclaimed and successful comic novels of the decade, Thank You for Smoking.

As the cat and mouse scurry about--on top of a chair, inside a box, outside a window, through a hole--young readers will learn about important prepositions that help them understand where one object is in relation to another. At the end of this colorful chase, the cat and mouse curl up together and nap until they're ready to start the whole thing again. Britta Teckentrup's eye-catching, simple illustrations are cleverly enhanced with cut-outs that help reinforce the words, providing a unique and fun interactive experience that teaches young readers about basic prepositions.</p><p>BRITTA TECKENTRUP has published dozens of highly acclaimed illustrated works for children, including <i>Oskar Loves..., Oskar and Mo, Oskar Can..., The Egg</i>, and <i>Birds and Their Feathers</i> (all by Prestel). She lives in Berlin, Germany.PreS-K-Cat sees Little Mouse and a chase ensues. But who will outsmart whom? Follow Mouse to the top of the wall, through the house, out the window, and along the path to see if he can escape the feline's pursuit. Written as a rhyming poem, this quirky, charming board book employs prepositions and die-cut pages to teach spatial relationships between common objects, such as boxes, holes, and stairs, while helping children make predictions about where Mouse will go next. Repetition in the text is emphasized by patterns in the illustrations, adding to the book's lyrical quality and sense of movement. Bold, clean lines and a large spread format encourages readers to participate by using their fingers to follow along with the characters on their quest.

It is also a symbol of Old World craftsmanship combined with American capitalism, of technological innovation, and of remarkable family management. This authoritative and entertaining book tells the story of the Steinway piano company and the people behind it.<br><br>The first book based on the rich archive of Steinway business and family papers at LaGuardia Community College in New York, as well as on interviews with family members and company employees in the United States, Germany, and England, <i>Steinway &amp; Sons</i> describes the making and marketing of an American cultural icon. Founded in New York in 1853 by a German immigrant, the Steinway company quickly rose to prominence on the strength of the distinctive "Steinway sound." For five generations Steinways steered their company in the face of vigorous domestic and foreign competition, bitter labor disputes, temperamental musicians, a fluctuating economy, and wars. Members of the Gilded Age elite, the family also contended with adultery, alcoholism, emotional depression, and long court battles over money. Lieberman discusses the company town the Steinways built in Queens in the 1870s to "escape the machinations of the anarchists and socialists" in the city; the decision to manufacture in both New York and Hamburg, which led to Steinway factories supplying both sides in World War II; the improvements in piano technology that made the Steinway the envy of other piano makers; the company's creative marketing techniques, such as booking celebrated European pianists into American concert halls; the competition from the Japanese-owned Yamaha company; and the sale of the financially troubled company to CBS in 1972. Weaving together themes from social, music, business, labor, and immigrant history, and lavishly illustrated with pictures from the Steinway archive, <i>Steinway &amp; Sons</i> is a rich narrative that casts new light on American cultural history and on a unique family enterprise.</p><p><b>Richard K. Lieberman</b> is professor of history at LaGuardia Community College of the City University of New York and director of the LaGuardia and Wagner Archives, which house the Steinway collection.Mr. Lieberman also gives us an often fascinating overview of a musical epoch that may, regrettably, be coming to an end. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, Eva Hoffman </i></p><h2>Snow White and Rose Red</h2><p>Snow White and Rose Red live on the edge of the forest that conceals the elusive border of Faerie. They know enough about Faerie lands and mortal magic to be concerned when they find two human sorcerers setting spells near the border. And when the kindly, intelligent black bear wanders into their cottage some months later, they realize the connection between his plight and the sorcery they saw in the forest. This romantic version of the classic fairy tale features an updated introduction by its editor, Terri Windling.</p><p>Patricia C. Wrede lives in Edina, Minnesota.Wrede's ( Caught in Crystal ) romantic and charming retelling of the Brothers Grimm tale is the fourth in this series. In the village of Mortlak, near the river Thames, during the reign of Elizabeth I, live the Widow Arden and her two daughters, Blanche and Rosamund. The widow, who supports her family by selling herbs and making healing potions, lives in fear of being accused of witchcraft. Her daughters gather the herbs she needs, sometimes crossing into the realm of Faerie, one of whose borders lies in the forest nearby. Also residing in Mortlak is the real-life Doctor Dee, astrologer to the Queen, who with his friend Edward Kelly seeks to harness the magic of Faerie. Their efforts turn Hugh, one of the half-human sons of the queen of Faerie, into a bear. With the aid of the widow and her daughters, John, the elder Faerie prince, tries to disenchant his brother, who has crossed over to the mortal world. John is initially thwarted in his efforts by Madini, head of a faction in Faerie that seeks complete separation from the mortal domain. In putting her twist on the classic tale, Wrede uses language appropriate to the period and nicely evokes both medieval England and a magic land. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Messenger Bags and Murder (A Haley Randolph Mystery)</h2><p>Amateur sleuth Haley Randolph returns in a hilarious new novella!Haley Randolph, fashionista and event planner to the stars, must find a way to stand out at the prestigious conference of the Hospitality Professionals of America&#x2014;not easy with a celebrity chef marinating in all the attention.But Haley gets distracted by five mouthwatering messenger bags from the world&#x2019;s hottest new designer, a delectable treat she can&#x2019;t resist&#x2014;and they're up for grabs!

He contrasts England, a country where property rights and parliamentary government advanced hand-in-hand, with Russia, where restrictions on ownership have for centuries consistently abetted authoritarian regimes; finally he provides reflections on current and future trends in the United States. <b>Property and Freedom</b> is a brilliant contribution to political thought and an essential work on a subject of vital importance.</p><p>Richard Pipes offers a vigorous defense of a fundamental freedom--private property--in this engaging mix of history, economics, and political theory. Western historians "take property for granted," complains the acclaimed scholar of Russian history (and author of the masterful <i>The Russian Revolution</i>). Pipes argues that a greater appreciation for this institution is necessary if liberty is to survive in the 21st century. "While property in some form is possible without liberty, the contrary is inconceivable," he says. Property rights give rise to the political and legal institutions that secure freedom. Their absence practically invites atrocity. The sinister regimes of Communist Russia and Nazi Germany were fiercely opposed to private property. Those regimes' "simultaneous violation of property rights and destruction of human lives," he emphasizes, "were not mere coincidences."<p> While the bulk of the book compares England and Russia, showing how varying attitudes toward private property led these two nations in totally different directions, the final section examines the broad theme of property rights in the late 20th century--a period when they have come under assault, and have been made increasingly conditional, by the growing strength of the welfare state. Pipes concludes with a broadside against New Deal and Great Society programs. Although liberal readers may bristle, none can deny that <i>Property and Freedom</i> is the product of a great mind tackling a big theme with great enthusiasm. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>"A most stimulating and original book. . . . One of the most valuable volumes on property yet." --<i>The American Spectator</i><br><br>"[<b>Property and Freedom</b>] is his most ambitious [book] ever.

It is so interlaced with Japanese cultural values and practices that scholarly studies usually focus on only one of its dimensions: Shinto as a "nature religion," an "imperial state religion," a "primal religion," or a "folk amalgam of practices and beliefs." Thomas Kasulis&#x2019; fresh approach to Shinto explains with clarity and economy how these different aspects interrelate.<br><br>As a philosopher of religion, he first analyzes the experiential aspect of Shinto spirituality underlying its various ideas and practices. Second, as a historian of Japanese thought, he sketches several major developments in Shinto doctrines and institutions from prehistory to the present, showing how its interactions with Buddhism, Confucianism, and nationalism influenced its expression in different times and contexts. In Shinto&#x2019;s idiosyncratic history, Kasulis finds the explicit interplay between two forms of spirituality: the "existential" and the "essentialist." Although the dynamic between the two is particularly striking and accessible in the study of Shinto, he concludes that a similar dynamic may be found in the history of other religions as well. <br><br>Two decades ago, Kasulis&#x2019; <i>Zen Action/Zen Person</i> brought an innovative understanding to the ideas and practices of Zen Buddhism, an understanding influential in the ensuing decades of philosophical Zen studies. <i>Shinto: The Way Home</i> promises to do the same for future Shinto studies.</p></p><p><b>Thomas P. Kasulis</b> is University Distinguished Scholar and Professor Emeritus in Comparative Studies at the Ohio State University, where he has taught in the departments of comparative studies, philosophy, and East Asian studies.Through illustration and example, Kasulis explains Shinto as have few previous scholars. As in his earlier <i>Zen Action/Zen Person,</i> the author demonstrates without recourse to jargon and agreed-upon models. His concern is not that you be impressed but that you understand, and the result is one of the finest books on Shinto now available. -- <b>Donald Richie</b>, Japan Times</p><h2>Never Stop Pushing: My Life from a Wyoming Farm to the Olympic Medals Stand</h2><p>Never Stop Pushing is a motivational autobiography by Olympic Greco-Roman champion wrestler Rulon Gardner (Gold Medal, 2000; Bronze Medal, 2004). This inspiring memoir comes from one of the world's most remarkable athletes who achieved arguably the greatest upset in individual sports history when he defeated the Russian Alexander Karelin &#x2014; three-time Olympic champ, undefeated and unscored upon for a decade before his match with Gardner &#x2014; in the 2000 Gold Medal match. Rulon Gardner tells the story of his impoverished upbringing as one of nine children in a close-knit Mormon family on a farm in Wyoming, where in performing unceasing chores he developed tremendous strength at an early age. Gardner writes about his struggles in school made arduous by learning disabilities that have challenged him his whole life. Also, after winning his Gold Medal, we read how this champion survived a snowmobile accident that marooned him outdoors for eighteen hours in high country. Rulon Gardner recovered from this and went on to defend his Gold Medal at Athens in 2004&#x2014;yet another comeback from this athlete who was supposed to simply fade away.</p><p>Rulon Gardner grew up in a Mormon family on a Wyoming dairy farm. He is a two-time Olympic Medalist (2000-Gold, 2004-Bronze) in Greco-Roman wrestling. His 2000 Gold Medal match is called "The Miracle on the Mat." He continues to give motivational speeches for corporations and events (i.e., Roche Pharmaceuticals, Special Olympics Hall of Fame Gala, Behr Paint, USO Navy Tour, etc.) charities, and schools across the country, as well as celebrity appearances at wrestling camps throughout the country. In addition, this year he will be honored at the Gene Autry Courage Awards in March in Phoenix as an athlete who has overcome physical adversity to succeed (also honored will be Bethany Hamilton, surfer whose arm was bitten off by a shark, and Aaron Ralston, climber who cut his arm off after it was trapped by a boulder), NASPE Hall of Fame Award in Chicago and the YMCA Honors (Person of the Year) in Salt Lake City. Rulon is also the color commentator for the Real Pro Wrestling league which will begin airing in March on Pax and Fox Sports. This fall Asics will release his signature shoe, the "Rulon." Rulon is the Spokesman for State Games of America and has become an honorary board member for the Sports for Kids Foundation. Rulon has decided to retire from Mixed Martial Arts competition, after his defeat of Yoshida in Japan on New Year's Eve.He lives in Wellsville, Utah.<br><br>Bob Schaller is the author of 30 books, including THE STATE OF THE GAME with Denny Crum, THE FIRST BLACK QUARTERBACK with Marlin Briscoe, and THE TOP STARS OF NASCAR. Schaller is also a contributing editor to SKATING, SPLASH and AMERICAN HOCKEY magazines.Gardner won an Olympic wrestling gold medal in the 2000 games with a stunning upset of Russian legend Alexander Karelin. He proved it was not a fluke with a bronze medal in the 2004 Olympics despite losing part of each foot to hypothermia in 2002. Remarkably, he was not a varsity wrestler until his senior year in high school. Gardner's high-school guidance counselors even advised against college, arguing that he was better suited to vocational school. But as is so often the case with the very successful, Gardner refused to take no for an answer and attended junior college, where he improved his grades and his wrestling enough to earn a scholarship to Nebraska. This is your basic inspirational success story, but Gardner and coauthor Schaller minimize the "look-at-me" factor with a self-deprecating tone and a stern admonition that it's the work that is admirable and the triumphs only a by-product. Nice reading for those who prefer athletes with tolerable egos. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Iconoclast. Political Survivor. The extraordinary story of the life and political career of Governor Jerry Brown.</strong><strong><br></strong>Jerry Brown is no ordinary politician. Like his state, he is eclectic, brilliant, unpredictable and sometimes weird. And, as with so much that California invents and exports, Brown's life story reveals a great deal about this country. <br> <br> With the exclusive cooperation of Governor Brown himself, Jim Newton has written the definitive account of Jerry Brown's life. The son of Pat Brown, who served as governor of California through the 1960s, Jerry would extend and also radically alter the legacy of his father through his own service in the governor's mansion. As governor, first in the 1970s and then again, 28 years later in his remarkable return to power, Jerry Brown would propound an alternative menu of American values: the restoration of the California economy while balancing the state budget, leadership in the international campaign to combat climate change and the aggressive defense of California's immigrants, no matter by which route they arrived. It was a blend of compassion, far-sightedness and pragmatism that the nation would be wise to consider.<br> <br> The story of Jerry Brown's life is in many ways the story of California and how it became the largest economy in the United States. MAN OF TOMORROW traces the blueprint of Jerry Brown's off beat risk-taking: equal parts fiscal conservatism and social progressivism. Jim Newton also reveals another side of Jerry Brown, the once-promising presidential candidate whose defeat on the national stage did nothing to diminish the scale of his political, intellectual and spiritual ambitions. <br><br> To the same degree that California represents the future of America, Jim Newton's account of Jerry Brown's life offers a new way of understanding how politics works today and how it could work in the future</p><p><b>Jim Newton </b>spent 25 years at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> as a reporter, editor, bureau chief, columnist, editor-at-large and editor of the editorial pages.

This luminous journey is marked by memories of his lonely childhood, secrets of his doomed young mother, and his passion for a woman who is as unreachable as the stars.</p><p>An improbable, sometimes inflated, but often amusing melodrama of the life and loves of a 43-inch Irish dwarf who's an amateur astronomer and soon-to-be-celebrated author--by astronomy professor and author Raymo (In the Falcon's Claw, 1990, etc.). Frank Bois is the ``wee'' son of a French WW II refugee, Bernadette Bois, and an unknown American sailor whose troopship set Bernadette down in the city of Cork in 1945. Frank, now middle-aged and living in the flat where his mother first settled 43 years earlier, has obsessively unearthed details of her past and recounts them in a narrative that parallels that of the book he's about to publish: how his clairvoyant mother, then 12, mysteriously became the only survivor of a German landmine explosion that killed ten other children in Fleurville, France, and how she was celebrated in the town as a saint; how her father, a farmer, was executed by the Germans and her mother went mad; how she stowed away aboard the troopship, ``fukked'' a score of sailors, and became pregnant at 16; how Jack Kelly, the wonderful Irish immigration officer in charge of her case, befriended her and, later, her hideous baby, a dwarf; how Jack taught the dwarf to love beauty and study the stars; how Bernadette, a great beauty herself, drove to ruin a number of men before she, too, went mad and committed suicide; how her son Frank, the dwarf, became a voyeur and pervert after falling unrequitedly in love with one of Jack's six beautiful daughters--a girl named Emma, who also went briefly crazy because of an evil affair with a German astronomer living in Cork; and how, finally- -after endless other adventures and many ruminations on whether beauty is skin-deep or resides in the stars or in the soul--how Frank wins middle-aged Emma's hand in an innocent, pure, romanticized version of marriage. At times overly ``philosophical'' and at other times disconcertingly bawdy, but, overall, an entertaining pastiche. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>"Begin with beauty," commands the opening sentence of this powerful novel, suffused with a 19th-century Romantic sensibility; its trite, although heartfelt, closing plea--"Hold me"--encapsulates the narrative's shift in focus from wide-ranging contemplation to the personal realization of love. Set in Cork, Ireland, this philosophic, imaginatively plotted tale is narrated by Frank Bois, a 43-year-old dwarf who has just completed a semi-autobiographical book. In a rambling internal dialogue he reminisces about the events his volume covers: his birth after WW II; his emotionally distant mother, who took many lovers; and his early decision to sublimate his sexuality (after a prostitute told him, "Be gone, ye little dork") by immersing himself in a passion for the moon and stars. Frank interrupts the chronological narrative with personal meditations, some about his writing career; he considers his book a literary freak show, knowing that people are amazed by his appreciation of beauty because, to them, he represents ugliness. Raymo ( In the Falcon's Claw ) so skillfully manipulates the author-within-an-author narration that it's easy to forget that Frank is a fictional entity. His unique, epiphanic and bluntly truthful story forces a reconsideration of the beautiful and the grotesque. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Key to Understanding Revelation, The</h2><p>The last chapter of a love story is how Arthur Bloomfield describes the book of Revelation.

Tim is the author of <em>No Ordinary Marriage </em>and <em>Discovering t</em><em>he Good Life</em>.</p><p>&#x201c;Tim Savage&#x2019;s <i>Discovering the Good Life</i> is a real accomplishment. It begins with one of the most universal of questions: <i>What is the good life?</i> Then it answers it by taking us through the Bible, summarizing its whole story through the intercanonical theme of three trees&#x2015;the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, the Tree of Life, and the great Branch, the shoot from the Stump of Jesse&#x2015;Jesus himself&#x2015;who took our curse by dying on a tree. This volume is ultimately an apologetic for the Christian life in response to a culture dedicated to seeking personal fulfillment but finding that very thing more and more elusive.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Timothy Keller</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Founding Pastor, Redeemer Presbyterian Church, New York City</p><p>&#x201c;With one foot planted firmly in Scripture and the other in culture, Tim Savage unpacks the fullness of life that can be ours right now.

We know what we want&#x2015;joy, peace, goodness&#x2015;but we seem to be searching in all the wrong places. In <i>Discovering the Good Life</i>, Tim Savage wisely explains the story of Scripture using three trees as guideposts. If you want to experience abundant life, this book faithfully leads you to the treasure of all treasures and the giver of all goodness: Jesus.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Melissa B.

Unhappy with the dry and pedagogic books available for children at the time, he wrote and illustrated <em>Struwwelpeter</em> as a Christmas present for his three-year-old son. The book relates in verse and pictures the sometimes gruesome consequences that befall children who torment animals, play with matches, suck their thumbs, refuse to eat, fidget at meals, etc.&nbsp; Written in rhyming couplets and illustrated by the author, the book was an immediate success. Each of the ten chapters has a clear moral that demonstrates the disastrous consequences of misbehavior.&nbsp; The title of the first story provides the title of the whole book. &nbsp;<em>Struwwelpeter</em> is one of the earliest books for children that combines visual and verbal narratives in a book format and is considered a precursor to comic books.&nbsp; It has since gone through hundreds of editions and been published in almost every European language. The present volume reprints 25 color plates from a German with the text of a standard English translation.</p></p><p></p><h2>SHANG-CHI: MASTER OF KUNG FU OMNIBUS VOL. 2</h2><p>Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu easily ranks as one of the most iconic series in Marvel history.

It is a sure recipe for losing respect for the institution. Media commentators are swift to dismiss the institution as outdated and elitist, an anachronism that should be replaced by a direct popular vote. In recent years, this discontent has found a voice as a well-funded, California-based effort seeks to bypass the constitutional amendment process and effectively eliminate the Electoral College through a series of state laws. Such efforts to eliminate the Electoral College are misguided, and this book shows why. Written in straightforward language, Enlightened Democracy traces the history of the Electoral College from the Constitutional Convention to the present. This second edition of the book is revised and expanded to include a new section about the National Popular Vote legislative effort. The Electoral College protects our republic and promotes our liberty. Americans should defend their unique presidential election system at all costs.</p><p>Following the contested election of 2000, opponents of the Electoral College were swift to dismiss the institution as outdated and elitist, an anachronism that should be replaced by a direct popular vote. Many of the nation&#x2019;s most prominent liberal politicians &#x2014; from Senator Hillary Clinton to House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt &#x2014; called for the institution to be abolished in order to "respect the will of the people." <p>The critics are wrong, and this book shows why. Written in straightforward language, Enlightened Democracy traces the history of the Electoral College from the Constitutional Convention to the present, and along the way it explains why the Framers took such pride in their now-controversial creation. After reading this book the case is clear: The Electoral College doesn&#x2019;t ignore the will of the people, but it does protect our republic and promote our liberty.</p>"[T]oday's electoral-vote system is not an 18th-century anachronism...The Constitution provides for the election of Presidents by states&#x2019; electoral votes, rather than individual popular votes, for an important reason: It enables citizens of a heterogeneous, free society to live peacefully alongside each other." - Pulitzer Prize winner George Will, from the Foreword <p>"The Electoral College...[is] a ridiculous setup, which thwarts the will of the majority, distorts presidential campaigning and has the potential to produce a true constitutional crisis." So proclaimed the August 29, 2004, edition of The New York Times in an editorial that called for the election of the President by a direct popular vote. </p><p>The New York Times is not alone. In the wake of George W. Bush&#x2019;s victory in the 2000 race, the first electoral triumph for a popular vote loser in more than 100 years, a growing number of commentators, politicians, and academics have called for the abolition of America&#x2019;s unique presidential election system. </p><p>In the face of this rising tide of criticism, American Enterprise columnist Tara Ross comes to the defense of this much-maligned institution. Using simple, straightforward language, Ross examines the Electoral College&#x2019;s beginnings and shows why it remains an important part of America&#x2019;s republican democracy. </p><p>In this thorough yet fast-moving survey, Ross explores: </p><p>� The reasons why the Founders created the Electoral College, showing that elitism was not one of them. </p><p>� JFK&#x2019;s somber warning about changing institutions, like the Electoral College, established in the Constitution. </p><p>� How the electoral system benefited both Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. </p><p>As she traces the Electoral College&#x2019;s origins back to the Constitutional Convention and tracks its performance across the following two centuries, Ross demonstrates that the presidential selection process is not an outdated institution that stifles majority rule. Instead, it is an invaluable safeguard that promotes consensus and moderation, and strengthens Americans&#x2019; ability to govern their country in the process. </p><p>While much has changed since the Electoral College&#x2019;s creation in 1787, it remains a vibrant and valuable institution. Alexander Hamilton once remarked that if the Electoral College "be not perfect, it is at least excellent." As Enlightened Democracy shows, Hamilton&#x2019;s praise is just as true today as it was two hundred years ago.</p></p><h2>Complete Symphonies in Full Score (Dover Orchestral Music Scores)</h2><p>"The charm of Schumann's symphonies lies in their never long repressed lyricism." &#x2014; <i>Grove's Dictionary</i><br> Although Schumann composed only four complete symphonies, the originality and lyrical qualities of his symphonic works have made them staples of the orchestral repertoire.

I know it's going to be passed urgently from hand to hand.</p> (Rosellen Brown <i>author of <i>Before and After</i></i>)</p><h2>Two Views of Hell: A Biblical &amp; Theological Dialogue (Spectrum Multiview Book)</h2><p>Hell is real and terrible. It is the fate of those who reject God. Evangelicals agree about this unhappy truth. Yet on some questions about hell disagreements arise. Some evangelicals believe the wicked will experience perpetual, conscious torment after death. Others argue that the wicked will experience a limited period of conscious punishment and then they will cease to exist. In this book you will find an irenic yet frank debate between two evangelical theologians who present strong scriptural and theological evidence for and against each view. Both make a case that their view is more consistent with Scripture and with the holy and just nature of a loving God. Robert Peterson defends the traditional view that those who do not have faith in Christ will suffer eternally in hell. Edward Fudge advocates the conditionalist perspective that after a period of suffering, the unfaithful will experience a complete extinguishing, or annihilation, of existence. In addition, each author presents a rebuttal to the viewpoint of the other. Here is a dialogue that will inform and challenge those on both sides, while impressing on all the need for faithful proclamation of the gospel of deliverance from sin and death.</p><p>Edward Fudge is a theologian and practicing lawyer based in Texas. He is the author of <em>The Fire That Consumes: A Biblical and Historical Study of the Doctrine of Final Punishment</em>.<br><br>Robert A. Peterson (Ph.D., Drew University) is professor of systematic theology at Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. His books include <em>Getting to Know John's Gospel, Hell on Trial, Calvin's Doctrine of the Atonement, Why I Am Not an Arminian </em> (with Michael D. Williams) and <em>Hell Under Fire</em> (coedited with Chris Morgan.Two distinguished authors convincingly present their opposing views on hell. Introductory remarks on both traditionalism (the belief that the wicked suffer in hell for eternity) and conditionalism (the belief that the wicked are punished by God and then destroyed) set the stage for the authors' in-depth studies. Edward Fudge, a practicing lawyer and theologian (The Fire That Consumes: The Biblical Case for Conditional Immortality) argues on behalf of conditionalism, drawing from a study of Old Testament figures, Jesus' teachings on hell, the writings of Paul and other New Testament verses and explanations. Robert Peterson (professor of theology at Covenant Theological Seminary and editor of the Presbyterian) responds from the traditionalist perspective, as his previous book's title (Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment) would suggest. Peterson provides readers with the positions of early Church Fathers and exegeted verses, and offers an overall theological look at why traditionalism is biblically sound. Each section ends with the other author debating the preceding arguments, contributing to the "dialogue" of the book. Throughout the text, both authors do their level best to dismantle the other's arguments. Professionals, seminary students and well-educated laity will find much to mull over here, though the average reader may consider the continual bantering somewhat tedious.

Stotesbury (PA) (Images of America)</h2><p>Whitemarsh Hall, known as "the Versailles of America," was one of the largest and most exquisite estates in North America. Edward Townsend Stotesbury, one of the wealthiest Philadelphians in the early twentieth century, commissioned renowned architect Horace Trumbauer to build the one-hundred-forty-sevenroom mansion in 1916 on three hundred acres just outside Philadelphia. Whitemarsh Hall, which took five years to build at an estimated cost of $10 million with all the furnishings, was a wedding present for his second wife. This book explores Whitemarsh Hall&#x2019;s construction, its heyday in the 1920s, the multiple impacts of the Great Depression, Stotesbury&#x2019;s death, and subsequent ownership over the next four decades, culminating in its eventual submission to decay, vandalism, and the wrecking ball in 1980.</p><p>The Springfield Township Historical Society was established in 1985, in large part as a result of the township and its interested residents losing battles to save significant historical buildings, including Whitemarsh Hall.

You have to catch up with it yourself.<br><br>Benjamin Franklin<br><br>I'm not sure how long he had been standing there. I was on the telephone when I sensed someone moving about outside my office. He must have heard me hang up, because he appeared within seconds--a tall, fiftyish man with close-cropped gray hair. When I asked if I might help him, he replied, "God, I hope so."<br><br>"We just arrived this afternoon," he said. "I'm hoping you'll have time to talk to my wife." I indicated a chair, and he introduced himself as James.<br><br>"We've been to a million doctors," he said. "I hear you work miracles."<br><br>"I'm hardly a miracle worker," I said, flattered nonetheless. "Suppose you tell me what this is all about."<br><br>In the next 10 minutes, he told the story of his wife, Serena, in such a straightforward manner that I wondered how many times he had recited it before. Her parents died when she was 8, and when no relatives could take her in, she landed in foster care. "I'm sure there are many good foster homes," he said, "but Serena wasn't that lucky. Hers was the kind you read about in those tabloids at the supermarket." He then proceeded to paint a detailed--and horrifying--picture of her young life, as she was bounced from foster home to foster home. In the last home, he said, she had been subjected to both sexual and emotional abuse and locked for hours at a time in a darkened closet. Ultimately, she simply ticked off the days until she felt she could survive on her own in the outside world.<br><br>At 16, she packed up her meager belongings, walked out the door, and never looked back. James met her when she was working the counter in a tiny takeout shop where he bought his morning coffee. Eventually, they married and adopted two beautiful babies who were now in their early teens. "She has never been able to forget her past, though," he said. "And lately, things seem to be spiraling downward. I'm really worried about her."<br><br>We arranged for her to come to my office the next afternoon.<br><br>Serena* was a small woman in her midthirties, with shoulder-length dark hair and dull gray eyes. I'll never forget the first thing she said or the sadness in her voice as she said it: "I don't like living like this, Dr. Baker. I've never been happy, and I don't believe I'll ever be happy."<br><br>I knew she didn't mean the last part because after all, she was in my office. At least she hadn't given up all hope.<br><br>I wanted to tell her that she was wrong, that she could be happy, that happiness is just a way of looking at life. It was clear from the story her husband had recounted that she had courage; she certainly had love, and I believed that if she looked deeply enough, she would find a way to fulfillment as well.<br><br>"I don't deserve my family," she said softly.<br><br>"And why is that?"<br><br>"Because I'm always sad. I put a damper on everything."<br><br>Listening to her was like listening to a tape on a player with failing batteries. The word apathy came immediately to my mind. Apathy is one of the hallmarks of depression. Given the choice of which I'd rather work with, an apathetic person or an angry one, I'll take the angry person every time. Give me someone who slams a fist on the desk or throws things at the walls over someone who believes there is no hope. Anger is just another negative emotion that eventually gets resolved. Apathy can take far longer. "Why not start at the beginning?" I said.<br><br>First she shared some memories of her parents and her early, happy times with them. (At least I knew there was a time when she had experienced true happiness, even if it was nearly three decades ago.) Then she told me how they died in an automobile accident, and she was sent to live with a foster family--the first of many. "The last was the worst," she said. She lowered her gaze to her lap, clasped her hands, and slowly began to speak of the unspeakable. Five minutes into her story, I stopped her in midsentence. "Serena," I said, "tell me about your children."<br><br>Immediately, her whole demeanor changed. She told of her son, "an incredible soccer player, captain of his traveling team," and her daughter, who had just starred in a ballet recital and is a marvelous student. As she spoke, her energy perked up, and she even managed a semblance of a smile.<br><br>I wasn't surprised. When I meet someone whose world has been rocked, I let them start talking, then I interrupt and ask them to tell me about someone they love or something in their lives they have great appreciation for. In that moment, the brain switches away from the painful subject to process the new topic. And so, almost within a snap of the fingers, Serena shifted from "I'm not good enough. I'm all alone. God help me; what's going to happen to me?" to "I've got these two amazing and beautiful children."<br><br>I kept going. "How did they get great?" I asked. "And isn't it remarkable that you can help human beings grow into the kind of people your children are?" I wanted her to recognize that she was a great success at parenting, and I wanted her to tell me so she would hear it herself. Sometimes people can point out the good in everyone else, but when you ask them about the good in themselves, they haven't got a clue.<br><br>The conversation drifted back to her past, and again I interrupted her. This time I suggested we take a walk outside.<br><br>It was a crystal clear, perfect Tucson day--the kind of day that every guest at Canyon Ranch prays they'll wake up to. As we walked, I said to her, "Serena, I want you to go to the first thing you see that's beautiful."<br><br>She stopped at a purple flower that sat on the edge of a still pond. "Look deep into the flower," I said.<br><br>She did.<br><br>"Now smell it."<br><br>She did.<br><br>"Now touch it."<br><br>She did that, too. Then she looked up at me as if waiting for her next instruction. Instead, I asked her a question, "How do you feel this second?"<br><br>"I feel . . . okay."<br><br>"Good. Let's go find something else that's beautiful, and you can tell me all about it."<br><br>She indicated a tall, beautifully symmetrical cactus, and we repeated the exercise. She said it reminded her of a favorite sculpture, and when I asked how she felt, she just smiled. I think she instinctively knew what was happening.<br><br>Here's the thing about love and appreciation. They are both positive emotions, and when you engage in either of them, or any other positive emotions, you cannot simultaneously be miserable. That's because the brain is not wired to process both a positive and a negative at the same time. Two things are important to know about positive and negative emotions. The first is that negative emotions have their place, which is to work for us in acute and sometimes life-threatening situations. Serena was no longer experiencing an acute situation, it's true, but she continued to function as if she were. That's because the human brain habituates to certain circumstances, particularly threatening circumstances that evoke strong negative emotions.<br><br>Because she had been down for so long, her neurological pathways had "grooved" so that even if she was no longer in an unpleasant situation, her brain thought she was. Essentially, it was easy for her to perceive threat almost continually. When one is in a state of constant vigilance, it depletes energy, and this was in large part responsible for her flat affect. Try being on guard duty 24/7, and see how you feel.<br><br>The second thing that's important to know about human emotions is that the brain's pathways for evocation of negative and positive emotions are different. In other words, you cannot be on two different streets at the same time. What I was doing in Serena's case was helping her to engage the lesser-used pathways of her brain so that eventually she might have a more positive perspective on life.<br><br>A Walk in the Desert<br><br>Serena's homework for the week she was at the ranch was to take an "appreciation walk" six times a day. Each afternoon, when she returned to my office, I asked her to talk about the beauty she saw around her. After a few days, we moved on to the beauty she saw in her husband, in her children, and finally in herself.<br><br>Had I asked her on the first day to talk about the beauty she saw in herself, she would have been stumped because she saw nothing but ugliness. Women and children who are abused by a more physically powerful male often escape the only way they can--by "running away" in their heads. The problem is, they generally can never run quite far enough to completely get away. Com�ding that situation is the fact that they see themselves as damaged goods, so they rarely return to who they were prior to the attack. It's a little bit like Dorothy in Oz, who couldn't get home until she accepted herself for who she really was. Serena tried to make some sense of her life by assuming there was something wrong with her, which there wasn't. It was her brain recalling the earlier times. It had never let go because, as you'll see later, it couldn't.<br><br>But she could.<br><br>Today's Serena--the one I had only just met--was a 36-year-old woman who had power and strength and potential she didn't know she had. When I got her to focus on love and beauty, she began to realize there were possibilities out there for her. She had only to look for them.<br><br>Once the pump was primed, she could talk about what was good in her life. I believe if we had jumped back into the darkness, we would have exacerbated that darkness. If I had taken her back to the days of the abuse, it would have proved nothing and might have made matters worse. My approach--that is, the approach of positive psychology--does not ignore the pain of life but instead shows how one can exercise the power of choice while engaging life from moment to moment. It is being proactive to a situation rather than reactive. It's one thing to try to fix a tangible object that is broken, but I have never seen the human psyche in that way. The psyche is not something to be repaired in the same way an orthopedist would set a shattered arm.<br><br>At our last meeting before she left the ranch, Serena and I discussed what she would do when she got home. She said she wanted to do something to make the world around her a better place. For her children in particular and perhaps, she said, for others as well. "Maybe for foster children. Girls, maybe. Like me." Serena understood that she couldn't erase what had happened to her--it would always be there--but she could transcend it. The memory would remain, but she found a way to live with it constructively and not try to distance herself from it. Essentially, we not only changed the playing field, but we also changed the rules. And it didn't take years of psychotherapy.<br><br>The day they left the ranch, Serena and James stopped in to say goodbye. Her eyes were bright, and her husband's eyes reflected hers. She had a new direction now: a purpose and a goal. The apathy was behind her. She saw possibilities in her life. She had hope.<br><br>Now, you may be wondering what exactly I did.<br><br>The Birth of Positive Psychology<br><br>The method I practice is called positive psychology. It is a rapidly growing movement that offers an alternative to clinical psychology. Unlike clinical psychology, which focuses on what's wrong with people, positive psychology shifts the emphasis to finding what's right with them. It works on the premise that identifying a person's virtues, strengths, and character and then building on them is far more helpful than pointing out a person's weaknesses and trying to fix them.<br><br>If asked to characterize positive psychology in general, I would say it is the study of the good life. It's the study of what's working. It's essential to understand that positive psychology is not only for the troubled. To the contrary. The idea is to take a life, even a good and happy life, and make it more meaningful. Even the happiest of people can and do benefit from this new discipline.<br><br>As you may have noticed with Serena, my method doesn't include burying life's painful experiences. I don't think anyone could, even if they wanted to. Rather, it embraces them as learning experiences and suggests using the new wisdom in a positive, practical way. Serena had a horrific childhood. For years, she visited doctors who tried to help her but failed because they kept asking her to relive the worst of what she'd been through. When I saw her, I quickly let her know I was more interested in her life now than in her past. I encouraged her to appreciate what she currently had, with an eye toward helping her find the possibilities in her future. Positive psychology is all about looking for possibilities.<br><br>Could Freud Have Been Wrong?<br><br>The science of clinical psychology began in Europe in 1879 as a discipline that concerned itself with things that impair the human mind, such as depression, neurosis, paranoia, anxiety, and delusions. Several decades later, Sigmund Freud introduced his theory of the unconscious and how it influences human behavior. He believed that people who kept their traumatic experiences locked away in a "black box" of memory, which he later dubbed the subconscious, would never be able to fully enjoy their lives until those deep-seated memories were brought to light--that is, to consciousness. Through psychoanalysis--the term he used for his new method of working with patients--Dr. Freud was convinced that he could talk a patient back to the experiences of childhood. Exploring what occurred during that time would be immeasurably beneficial for bringing them peace-- or so he thought.<br><br>Dr. Freud's work laid the foundation for clinical psychology in America, where for years it was considered a subset of psychiatry. In 1920, Alfred Adler, MD, convened a meeting of his psychologist peers and suggested the profession would be more highly regarded if it fashioned itself after Western medical practices. Doctors were directed to diagnose and relieve patients' symptoms, and those patients who could function in society were considered "cured."</p><h2>Great Expectations (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p><b>Introduction by George Bernard Shaw �&nbsp;Nominated as one of America&#x2019;s best-loved novels by PBS&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Great American Read</i></b><br><br> Pip, a poor orphan being raised by a cruel sister, does not have much in the way of great expectations&#x2014;until he is inexplicably elevated to wealth by an anonymous benefactor.

His family is convinced he drowned, but Jesse suspects something more sinister. Until Timmy appeared, Jesse&#x2019;s biggest problem was that her best friend, Maggie Keegan, aka Sister Angelina the Catholic nun, might not be allowed to be her maid of honor. But that pales in comparison to what Jesse faces now: Timmy was Maggie&#x2019;s little brother. And Jesse knows that if Timmy is ever to find peace, he needs to reveal the mystery of his disappearance&#x2014;which could subject Maggie and her family to some painful secrets and truths.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</h2><p><b>Renowned educator Christine King Farris, older sister of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., joins with celebrated illustrator Chris Soentpiet to tell this inspirational story of how one boyhood experience inspired a movement.</b><br><br><i>Mother Dear, one day I&#x2019;m going to turn this world upside down.</i><br> <br>Long before he became a world-famous dreamer, Martin Luther King Jr. was a little boy who played jokes and practiced the piano and made friends without considering race. But growing up in the segregated south of the 1930s taught young Martin a bitter lesson&#x2014;little white children and little black children were not to play with one another. Martin decided then and there that something had to be done. And so he began the journey that would change the course of American history.</p><p>Christine King Farris is the sister of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the only surviving member of the King family. She is the author of the children's book <i>My Brother Martin</i> and has been on the&nbsp;faculty of&nbsp;Spelman College since 1958. She lives with her husband in Atlanta.<br><br>Chris Soentpiet (pronounced: <i>soon-peet)</i> is a recipient of a gold medal from the Society of Illustrators; has received accolades from the International Reading Association, <i>Parents</i> magazine, the American Library Association, the <i>School Library Journal,</i> the <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> the <i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> and the Smithsonian; and has been recognized by the American Society of Portrait Artists Foundation. When not painting, Chris visits schools across the country promoting the love of children's literature and the arts. An honor graduate from Pratt Institute of Art, he lives in New York City with his wife. To learn more about Chris, visit his Web site at Soentpiet.com.Farris's stirring memoir of her younger brother "M.L." focuses on a pivotal moment in their childhood in Atlanta. The conversational narrative easily and convincingly draws readers into the daily life of Christine and her two brothers, M.L. and A.D., as they listen to their grandmother's stories, stage pranks and romp in the backyard with two white brothers from across the street. The adults in the King family-Daddy, a minister; Mother Dear, a musician; maternal grandparents (the grandfather is also a minister) and a great-aunt-try to shield the children from the overt racism of the times; the family rarely took streetcars, for example, because of "those laws [segregation], and the indignity that went with them." When the white boys announce one day that they cannot play with M.L. and A.D. because they are "Negroes," the young Kings are hurt and baffled. Mother Dear explains, "[Whites] just don't understand that everyone is the same, but someday, it will be better." M.L. replies, "Mother Dear, one day I'm going to turn this world upside down." Soentpiet (Dear Santa, Please Come to the 19th Floor) illustrates this exchange with a powerful watercolor portrait of mother and son that encapsulates many emotions, including hope, pain and love. Unfortunately, in other paintings, the characters often seem frozen in exaggerated poses, or minor figures are rendered with less skill than demonstrated elsewhere. These inconsistencies detract from an otherwise gripping volume that makes the audience aware that heroes were once children, too.

He was just an ordinary kid who played sports, volunteered at his local fire department, and eventually headed off to college and then Wall Street to start a career. Throughout it all, he always kept a red bandanna in his pocket, a gift from his father. On September 11, 2001, Welles was working on the 104th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center when the Twin Towers were attacked. That day, Welles made a fearless choice, and in doing so, saved many lives. <br><br> The survivors didn&#x2019;t know his name, but one of them remembered a single detail clearly: the man was wearing a red bandanna. Welles Crowther was a hero. <br><br> Award-winning ESPN reporter Tom Rinaldi brings Welles's inspirational story of selflessness and compassion to life in this accessible young readers&#x2019; adaptation of his <i>New York Times</i> bestselling book. This powerful story of making a difference through our actions is perfect for helping the post-9/11 generation understand the meaning of this historic day through the eyes of one young man.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rinaldi&#x2019;s young reader edition of his award-winning adult story puts a face on that day (9/11), a hero&#x2019;s face, and brings to young people someone who stood brave in the toughest of times and who, in the end, was lost doing his best to help others survive.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>VOYA </i></p><p>Tom Rinaldi has been a national correspondent at ESPN since 2002. A recipient of ten national Sports Emmy Awards and five Edward R. Murrow Awards, he covers human-interest stories across all sports, including his famous feature story about Welles Crowther. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and a native of Brooklyn, Tom now lives in New Jersey with his wife, Dianne, and their two children, Jack and Tess.Gr 6&#x2013;8&#x2014;Before leaving for church one day, Jeff Crowther gave his then seven-year-old son, Welles, a red bandanna to keep in his pocket, similar to his own blue bandanna. For the rest of Welles's life, that red piece of fabric remained a constant reminder of his special bond with his father while also serving a variety of practical purposes&#x2014;a handkerchief, a headband worn underneath a hockey helmet, and eventually a useful piece of life-saving equipment. Welles was working on the 104th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center when it was struck by a plane on the morning of September 11, 2001. Physically unharmed and able to escape, altruistic Welles chose instead to assist an estimated 18 people to safety using his junior firefighter training. To those he helped that day, he was known only as the man with the red bandanna, until, through newspaper reports from eyewitness accounts, his family was able to piece together his final moments of self-sacrifice and courage. At times a documentation of history, at others an emotional journey, this remarkable true story of bravery and heroism places readers directly inside the South Tower as events unfolded; Rinaldi's writing heightens the senses capturing the smoke, heat, and smells, while also making the uncertainty, confusion, urgency, and raw human emotion very real&#x2014;a feat not often accomplished in books for this age group. Drawing upon firsthand accounts from family members and friends, readers receive a sense of Welles's optimism, leadership, perseverance, and his genuine desire to help others. VERDICT Impossible to read without an emotional response, this title is an essential purchase for nonfiction collections.&#x2014;Rebecca Gueorguiev, New York Public Library</p><h2>How the Piloses Evolved Skinny Noses (Evolving Minds)</h2><p>The piloses are a busy species, spending their days snuffling up the millibugs that keep them healthy and strong.

This book helps evangelicals who are exploring Roman Catholicism to sort out the kinds of concerns that typically come up in discerning whether to enter into the full communion of the Catholic Church. In simple language, it explains many theological misunderstandings that evangelicals often have about Roman Catholicism, and suggests the kind of practical steps many take to enter the Catholic Church. The book frames evangelicals becoming Roman Catholic as a kind of &#34;paradigm shift&#34; involving the buildup of anomalies about evangelicalism, a crisis of the evangelical paradigm, a paradigm revolution, and the consolidation of the new Roman Catholic paradigm. It will be useful for both evangelicals interested in pursuing and understanding Roman Catholicism and Catholic pastoral workers seeking to help evangelical seekers who come to them.</p><p>Christian Smith is the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame. He is the author of The Bible Made Impossible (2011), What is a Person? (2010), and Souls in Transition (2009)."While showing appreciation and respect for his evangelical patrimony, Christian Smith offers a careful, clear, and thoughtful path to the Catholic Church for those evangelicals who are entertaining Catholicism as they seek to walk more authentically in Christ. This is a truly unique contribution to the growing literature authored by former evangelicals who have found their way to St. Peter's barque." <br>-Francis J. Beckwith<br>author of Return to Rome: Confessions of An Evangelical Catholic<br><br>"Christian Smith is correct in describing why it usually takes a 'paradigm revolution' for an evangelical to become a Catholic. The 'anomalies' he describes for evangelical life are mostly accurate and his presentation of Catholicism is attractive. But this intriguing book would have been even better if it had paused to reflect on why there are so many paradigm shifts in the other direction--of people born Catholic who become evangelical. Anyone--Catholic, evangelical, or a convert in either direction--who responds thoughtfully to the arguments of this book will be a better Christian for having made the effort."<br>-Mark Noll<br>author of The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind<br><br>"I expect that this book may turn out to be the definitive text (short of the Fathers only!) for evangelicals who are prepared to address themselves courageously to the ecclesiological question.

It is a love story set against the surreal excess of Las Vegas&#x2014;and the artificial suburbs, gated communities, and freeways that surround it&#x2014;where broken lives come to seek new beginnings and casinos feed the lust of tourists and residents alike. Ultrasophisticated local kids grow up fast and burn out early.<br><br>After attending college in New York, Chase returns to Vegas and is drawn into the lucrative but dangerous world of a teenage call-girl service with his childhood friend Michele, a beautiful Salvadoran immigrant with whom he shares a tragic past. Over the course of one extraordinary summer they will confront the violence and emptiness at the heart of the city and their generation.<br><br>At once stark and electrically atmospheric, horrifying and hopeful, <i>The Delivery Man</i> is an ambitious literary novel as well as a fast and absorbing page-turner&#x2014;and a powerful indictment of a society in which personal responsibility has been abandoned, lust is increasingly mistaken for love, and innocence is an anachronism.</p><p>"At first glance, this debut novel looks like a good, short read for the next time you're waiting at the airport. It's an insider's guide to the dark underbelly of twenty-first-century Las Vegas, brimming with brand names, hard bodies, hard drugs, and heavy doses of sex and violence. If that's all you're looking for, <i>The Delivery Man</i> won't disappoint. . . . But once you finish it, you won't be able to get it out of your mind--McGinniss uses his fast-paced, B-movie plotline to explore how the flip side of the American dream can often be an inescapable nightmare, much like F. Scott Fitzgerald manipulated the melodrama of <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. In fact, <i>The Delivery Man</i>, like <i>Gatsby</i>, is the story of a lost generation. While Fitzgerald's flappers danced as fast as they could before their world collapsed in Depression and war, McGinniss's losers are stranded in an empty landscape of dead sex, coked-out emotion, and pointless danger. To his credit, McGinniss refuses to take the easy, ironic way out favored by so many contemporary writers who distance the reader from the characters. You see these doomed, wretched people for what they are, and then McGinniss allows them to break your heart. <i>The Delivery Man</i> is that rare first novel that could well become a classic." --Peter Bloch, <i>Penthouse</i> <br><br> "This debut novel from the son of the famed true-crime reporter is a searing portrait of young wastrels adrift in a vacuous Las Vegas. Chase couldn't cut it as an NYU art student and now finds himself mired in old, self-destructive patterns. Fired from his high-school teaching job following a fistfight with one of his students, he falls into a job chauffeuring a ring of teenage call girls to clients' homes. The ring is run by an old friend, an acquisitive Salvadoran immigrant who longs to buy a home in one of the ubiquitous new housing developments springing up in the desert. Although Chase is engaged to an ambitious business grad student and is himself struggling to finish a group of paintings for a gallery opening, he finds his sense of purpose draining away. Unsavory business partners and old vendettas soon come into fast and furious play. McGinniss never wavers from his ruthless portrayal of the morally bankrupt, and some readers may be put off by the unlikable characters, but this atmospheric page-turner gains increasing depth as it barrels toward a gut-wrenching conclusion." --Joanne Wilkinson, <i>Booklist</i>Praise for <i>The Delivery Man</i>: <br><br> "A dead-of-night story surehandedly told in a pared-down, teeth-bared style reminiscent of Joan Didion--nothing stated but everything implied. This is writing not so much about the what as much as the how in the ungracious space of lives taken as they come in a nightmare Las Vegas that is nevertheless someone's home." <b>--Janet Fitch, author of <i>White Oleander</i> and <i>Paint It Black</i></b> <br><br> "A gripping literary thriller and an auspicious debut." <b>--George Pelecanos, author of <i>The Night Gardener</i> and <i>Drama City</i></b> <br><br> "This is a thrilling debut--a novel about youth wasting itself knowingly against the laid-back, glossy, trademark amorality of Las Vegas, told in a voice that sounds like that of a slightly older, hipper Holden Caulfield, coming of age in a place which has no past or future--only the cool, gleaming, terrifying present. Sexy, touching, always shrewdly observed, and with a killer ending, <i>The Delivery Man</i> is the <i>Less Than Zero</i> of the early 2000s--and the first step in what I am sure will be a remarkable career." <b>--Michael Korda, author of <i>Ike</i> and <i>Charmed Lives</i></b> <br><br> "Powerful and compelling, a novel of nonstop tension in a landscape so modern, so up to the minute, that you can set your watch by it. And while it reminds me of Hunter Thompson and Robert Stone, it is also a book by a young writer whose talent is at once fierce and entirely new. Fresh, haunting, the kind of book that keeps you up at night to turn the pages." <b>--Craig Nova, author of <i>Cruisers</i> and <i>The Good Son</i></b> <br><br> "Traveling through a Las Vegas no tourist ever sees, <i>The Delivery Man</i> vibrates with heat and fear, sex and heartbreak. This is a fast and terrifying novel--definitely not a ride for the squeamish." <b>--Jill Eisenstadt, author of <i>From Rockaway</i> and <i>Kiss Out</i></b> <br><br> "<i>The Delivery Man</i> is a brutally clear-eyed and beautifully built story that shines a light on Las Vegas' dark underbelly. In its unforgettable characters, its unflinching examination of a piece of America most of us would like to pretend does not exist, and its probing of the darkest urges of the human psyche, this novel has all the force and authority of top-shelf fiction, and marks the arrival of an important new voice on the American literary scene." <b>--Roland Merullo, author of <i>In Revere, in Those Days</i> and <i>A Little Love Story</i></b> <br><br> "Poor Chase: he feels like God's Lonely Man, all longing and disillusionment, and no one disappoints him more than he disappoints himself. He's part of a longstanding American tradition of hard guys with soft centers, guys with an exquisitely calibrated sense of their own self-degradation, like one of Bret Easton Ellis's heroes refracted through Raymond Chandler. <i>The Delivery Man</i> is arresting on the way, in the face of our undoing, we're inadequate but still culpable, and idealistic but still paralyzed." <b>--Jim Shepard, author of <i>Like You'd Understand, Anyway</i></b></p><h2>Beside the Sea</h2><p><p><strong>A haunting and thought-provoking story about how a mother's love for her children can be more dangerous than the dark world she is seeking to keep at bay.</strong></p> A single mother takes her two sons on a trip to the seaside.

He lives in Belgrade and Toronto.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Wacky, weird, and wonderful words wend their way through these three short stories written by the wise and witty Atwood. Three wildly silly and humorous tales use alliteration from beginning to end. In "Rude Ramsay and the Roaring Radishes," Rude Ramsay and his red-haired, revolting relatives, Rollo, Ron, and Ruby, battle over their ridiculous, rotten repasts (dinners). Rude and his rat friend, Ralph, run away and encounter a group of roaring robot radishes bent on destroying everything around them. The two friends find relief and refuge when they meet a new ally, Rilla, who resides in a romantic rectory. In "Bashful Bob and Doleful Dorinda," Bob is abandoned outside a beauty parlor where his bubblehead mother is having her hair dyed blonde. He is found and adopted by a trio of dogs&#x2014;a beagle, a boxer, and a borzoi. On the same block lives Doleful Dorinda. Her parents are missing after a deadly disaster, and she is taken in by distant relatives who force her into distasteful, distressing servitude. As fate would have it, Doleful Dorinda and Bashful Bob meet, and she dedicates herself to teaching him how to speak instead of bark. "B" and "D" words repeat to the satisfying conclusion, when Bob and Dorinda are reunited with their parents and both families buy a bungalow. There, they, along with the dogs, "dwell in blinding bliss, delirious with delicious delight." "Wandering Wenda" features woeful Wenda, alone after a whirlwind. She and her faithful woodchuck, Wesley, wander wistfully in search of her parents. They come upon Widow Wallop, in her wide-wheeled wood wagon pulled by two Welsh ponies, who kidnaps them. Wenda and Wesley are taken to her Wunderground Washery, where they are made to do "weeks and weeks of washing in the wet and weltering cellar." Wu, Wanapitai, and Wilkinson, the waifs welcoming Wenda and Wesley to the washery, have also lost their parents in a weird whirlwind. Wolves, rabbit warrens, and wizardry bring this narrative to a fast-paced finish as the witchy widow is discovered to truly be Willup the Whirlwind Whiz. He is obliged to wave his wand and whisk the parents back from the wispy clouds. The whimsical black-and-white illustrations pair handsomely with the text. Not only can this book be read aloud or silently for readers' enjoyment, it can also be used to introduce the concept of alliteration. VERDICT The wide and varied vocabulary will enrich even the most erudite student; an excellent and unusual addition to most collections.&#x2014;D. Maria LaRocco, Cuyahoga Public Library, Strongsville, OH</p><h2>Bulldozer</h2><p>ill Crane, just out of high school and eager for a job, goes on a June fishing trip with his friend, Ducky Davis, to a lake in the Maine wilderness. More important than the bass they catch is the discovery of a Caterpillar D2 Tractor sunk and abandoned in the lake. How Bill locates the owner and buys the machine, how he and Ducky get it out of the water and make it run, is a tale that will thrill every mechanically minded boy. Of still broader interest is the story of Bill&#39;s plucky battle to build a contracting business from that modest start. He makes enemies, but he makes loyal friends as well. Willing to tackle any job with his little bulldozer, he clears orchards, digs cellars, moves buildings, plows fields, skids logs, and fights forest fires. Finally, in an exciting climax, he wins an important earth-moving contract against strong and unscrupulous competition. This is a story of a sturdy machine and a boy with courage, ingenuity, and grit. It could happen in few places on earth except America.</p><p></p><h2>Your Hidden Destiny Revealed: Encountering God&#39;s Hidden Strategy for Your Life (Heavenly Encounters)</h2><p>As you enter into your destiny with God, you will see that He has your purpose and destiny hidden for the right time to be revealed.It Is all in your favor.

It is the story of how human beings began their great adventure of learning how to live; of how they have sought to satisfy the practical needs of their bodies, the questioning of their minds, and the searching of their spirits. To this end it subordinates details of political events to the record of things that lie at the foundation or our modern civilization. Dorothy Mills had an uncanny and unique ability to write history that is interesting and at the same time based on sound scholarship. Her direct, engaging approach is valued increasingly by the many parents in our day who are looking for reliable materials for home study, as well as by many private school educators. The highly-prized six volumes of her historical works (see below) have become very scarce on the used book market, and so Dawn Chorus has undertaken to reprint them as part of its effort to offer texts ideally suited to the needs of a new generation of teachers and students. In a world where the quality of education has so deteriorated, may the reissue of this wonderful historical series shine as a beacon to a new generation of young (and not so young) scholars!. Dawn Chorus publishes these five other books by Dorothy Mills: The Book of the Ancient Greeks; The Book of the Ancient Romans; The People of Ancient Israel; The Middle Ages; and Renaissance and Reformation Times. Dawn Chorus has also republished another outstanding, and long-out-of-print historical series perfectly suited for home or school use (and highly recommended in home-school curricula), entitled The Picturesque Tale of Progress, by Olive Beaupr� Miller.

Edwards Award for lifetime achievement in writing for young adults, a three-time National Book Award Finalist, as well as the first-ever recipient of the Coretta Scott King-Virginia Hamilton Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p><b>The Land</b></p><p>To understand the story of the African-American experience, we have to begin with the land. North America, incredibly rich and beautiful, stretching forever westward from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, was irresistible. There were mountain ranges through which rivers coursed, bringing minerals to the lush valleys and plains below. That the climate was right for agriculture was evident from the crops of the brown- and copperskinned people we call Native Americans today.</p><p>For Europe it was the age of exploration. Kings and queens, wealthy merchants, sometimes even private individuals, hired ships to travel the world. They were chiefly looking for faster trade routes to the Far East and new sources of gold, silver, and spices. What they found in their travels westward was the land that would one day become the United States.</p><p>Living on this land were many different groups of peoples: The Navaho were largely nomadic, constantly on the move, while the Seneca had lived in a relatively small area of the northeast for hundreds of years. Toward the middle of the continent the Erie Indians lived in the area of the Great Lakes. The Seminole were largely in the southeast, while in the southwest the Hopi built three- and four-story structures, sometimes with hundreds of rooms.</p><p>These peoples had lived on this land with their villages, their governments, their beliefs, and their customs, for thousands of years.</p><p>The Europeans called the land North <i>America</i>, after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci. Earlier Christopher Columbus, an explorer sailing under the flag of Spain, had reached the island of San Salvador, south of Florida, and had called the people he found there "Indians." Soon the Europeans were calling all the peoples of North America Indians.</p><p>While some explorers were crossing the Atlantic Ocean, others, such as Diogo Cao and Bartholomeu Dias of Portugal, were making important discoveries along the west coast of Africa.</p><p>Griots--African storytellers--speak of African kingdoms that stretch back hundreds of years before the birth of Christ. By the ninth century the religion of Islam had spread its influence among the early inhabitants of ancient Ghana. The kingdom of Ghana gave way to that of Mali, with its center of learning at Timbuktu and the beginnings of the gold trade across the Sahara Desert, and by the end of the fifteenth century, Sunni Ali Ber and Askia Muhammad I, the great leaders of the powerful Songhai Empire, were legendary figures.</p><p>In the 1400's, long caravans of traders made their way from the forests of the Yoruba across the continent to Egypt in east Africa. Merchants from France, England, India, and Holland traded for African gold and ivory in crowded north-African markets. But sub-Saharan Africa was cut off from Europe by the desert.</p><p>In the early sixteenth century, when Europeans began to explore the world by ship, the riches of the west African coast were discovered. Soon Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and English companies began to build trading posts along the coast. They also sought colonies in what they called the "New World."</p><p>In 1584 the Englishman Walter Raleigh started such a colony on the eastern coast of North America in a place he called Virginia. The early colonists found no cities in North America to rival those in Great Britain and Europe. What they did find was a land of richness and beauty and the possibility of enormous wealth that free land promised.</p><p>English, Dutch, and Spanish settlements sprang up along the east coast of North America, while smaller Spanish and French settlements appeared in the west. English settlements were named Virginia, Delaware, and Maryland. New Amsterdam was Dutch, and Florida was claimed by the Spanish.</p><p>The largest tracts of land were settled by the British, who sent hundreds of settlers to the southern part of the continent with offers of free land for people who would promise to develop it. The idea, of course, was that the people developing the land would be British, and so the British Empire, already the largest in the world, would continue to grow.</p><p>In a world in which most people survived by farming, the land grants were extremely attractive. America was described by many as the best poor man's country in the world. The cost of buying land in America was less than the annual taxes would have been on the same land if it had been in England.</p><p>Typical in many ways of the early American colonists were two English brothers, William and John Dandridge. William, a handsome, self-assured man with a great sense of presence, was an officer in the Royal Navy. Young John, only fourteen years old but bright and ambitious like his brother, was still looking for a profession. They left behind another brother, Bartholomew Dandridge, who became a noted portrait painter. His paintings are on display in the National Portrait Gallery in London.</p><p>The opportunities for the Dandridges, had they remained in England, were only fair; in America, with hard work and inexpensive land, they might make their fortunes. Around the year 1711, uncertain of what life would be like in the largely unpopulated land, they decided to try their luck. William Dandridge settled in Virginia, near the Pamunkey River; John would later build a house nearby on the other side of the same river.</p><p>The Dandridges, like many colonists who came to North America, were to become closely entangled with the lives of the Africans who were brought there. Through the course of this book we will follow their story over the years.</p><p>The land was plentiful and rich, but who would work it? It didn't make sense for a colonist to work for somebody else when land down the road could be had for practically nothing. It became clear that what was needed in the new colonies was a new supply of laborers whose ambitions could be limited.</p></p><h2>The Dark Arts of Blood (Blood Wine Sequence)</h2><p>In 1920s Switzerland, vampire lovers Charlotte and Karl are drawn into turmoil as Godric Reiniger, a local filmmaker and activist with sinister ambitions, begins his rise to power.<br><br>Meanwhile, fiery dancer Emil achieves his dream to partner the legendary ballerina and vampire Violette Lenoir &#x2013; until his forbidden desire for her becomes an obsession.

Spacesuits (Springer Praxis Books)</h2><p><p>Spacesuits are far more than garments. They are a personalized spacecraft that allows direct contact and interaction with everything beyond our world, and a last refuge for survival in a disaster. Creating safe, reliable, and comfortable spacesuits is an ongoing challenge that has spanned over four decades. "U. S. Spacesuits, 2nd Edition" by Kenneth S. Thomas and Harold J. McMann details the technical evolution of U. S. spacesuits from their roots in high altitude aviation and vacuum tube development to present day, with an additional look into the future. This primary source of spacesuit information explains the functions, historical development, and use of spacesuits from a worldwide perspective. In this new edition, the authors update the story of U.S. spacesuit development and efforts, from the design challenges modern engineers face to the latest roles of spacesuits in space exploration. </p><p>The book also provides a close up look at NASA's new Constellation Space Suit System as well as Apollo prototype configurations that have been discovered since 2005. Also not in the earlier edition is a prototype and model of the Gemini pressure suit and an explanation of its development. Finally, there are new insights into the suits used for the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Space Shuttle, and International Space Station missions.</p></p><p><p>As a second generation space engineer, Thomas grew up with U.S. space programs. He worked as a task-manager/engineer on the Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU, NASA's current going-out-in-spacesuit-system) program and was a principal investigator on next generational suit.

Blumstein offer this passionate indictment of environmental education&#x2015;along with a new vision for the future. Writing for general readers and educators alike, Saylan and Blumstein boldly argue that education today has failed to reach its potential in fighting climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation. In this forward-looking book, they assess the current political climate, including the No Child Left Behind Act, a disaster for environmental education, and discuss how education can stimulate action&#x2015;including decreasing consumption and demand, developing sustainable food and energy sources, and addressing poverty. Their multidisciplinary perspective encompasses such approaches as school gardens, using school buildings as teaching tools, and the greening of schoolyards. Arguing for a paradigm shift in the way we view education as a whole, <i>The Failure of Environmental Education </i>demonstrates how our education system can create new levels of awareness and work toward a sustainable future.</p><p>&#x201c;The hope for the future depends on teaching current and future students the analytical and critical thinking skills for dealing with the most critical problems. My own hope is for this book to be read by everyone, even those outside the field of environmental education.

Following the Green Line of the civil war, dividing the Christian east and the Muslim west, today hundreds of such lines dissect the city. For the residents of Beirut, urban planning could hold promise: a new spatial order could bring a peaceful future. But with unclear state structures and outsourced public processes, urban planning has instead become a contest between religious-political organizations and profit-seeking developers. Neighborhoods reproduce poverty, displacement, and urban violence. <i>For the War Yet to Come</i> examines urban planning in three neighborhoods of Beirut's southeastern peripheries, revealing how these areas have been developed into frontiers of a continuing sectarian order. Hiba Bou Akar argues these neighborhoods are arranged, not in the expectation of a bright future, but according to the logic of "the war yet to come": urban planning plays on fears and differences, rumors of war, and paramilitary strategies to organize everyday life. As she shows, war in times of peace is not fought with tanks, artillery, and rifles, but involves a more mundane territorial contest for land and apartment sales, zoning and planning regulations, and infrastructure projects.</p><p><b>Hiba Bou Akar</b> is Assistant Professor in the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University. She has also worked as an architect and urban planner in Beirut."How do you plan cities when the specter of war is always present? Hiba Bou Akar places 'planning' on its head to show how Beirut has developed to serve a sectarian order. Fascinating, theoretically astute, and empirically rich, <i>For the War Yet to Come</i> enriches our understanding of fragile cities in the Middle East and beyond." (Asef Bayat, University of Illinois <i>Urbana-Champaign</i>)<br><br>"Once in a while, a book comes along that makes a field of inquiry reconsider its assumptions, categories, and vocabularies. Through elegant ethnography and nuanced theorization, Hiba Bou Akar's <i>For the War Yet to Come</i> gives us a new way of thinking about violence, development, modernity, and ultimately, the city. This city is not just Beirut but rather urban life everywhere." (Ananya Roy <i>University of California, Los Angeles</i>)<br><br>"Hiba Bou Akar's <i>For the War Yet to Come</i> is an important contribution, shedding light on urban planning in unstable contexts....I highly recommend this book to readers interested in further understanding how urban planning could be viewed as a sword with two edges, for consensus or conflict building." (Christine Mady <i><i>International Journal of Middle East Studies</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>For the War Yet to Come</i> upends our conventional notions of center and periphery, of local and transnational, even of war and peace. It takes courage and smarts to navigate these spaces, let alone to write about them. With daring and precision, Hiba Bou Akar proves herself to be a complete master." (AbdouMaliq Simone <i>Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity</i>)<br><br>"Bou Akar is able to assess how years of sectarian warfare and conflict have turned Beirut into an arena for competing religious/political parties and groups to seize footholds and influence in the city. [Her] in-depth analysis reveals a painful reality: Beirut's urban planning reflects Lebanon's political factions' acceptance of the inevitable continuation of sectarian violence and human displacement." (Refael Kubersky <i><i>Middle East Journal</i></i>)<br><br>"Hiba Bou Akar convincingly reveals the considerable weight of the anticipation of war and violence in the production of urban geographies in one emblematic contested city, Beirut. She names this phenomenon 'the war yet to come.' The mechanisms she skillfully describes are profoundly anchored in the urban dynamics of this city but could also be easily found in other cities....an enormous effort that succeeds in describing how fear of 'the war yet to come' is profoundly affecting urban and territorial dynamics in the contested suburbs of Beirut." (Oula Aoun <i><i>H-Nationalism</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>For the War Yet to Come</i> is a feminist and postcolonial critique of a masculinized geography of urban militarism that favors the spectacular and the sublime. This vision of the city at war is blindingly technological and curiously devoid of people, as if seen from above (perhaps from a fighter jet). Bou Akar's Beirut is peopled, swirling with rumor. It is the site not of anonymized destruction but of calculated and complex construction."

Delving into the history, philosophy, and even politics of object-oriented programming, West reveals how the best programmers rely on analysis and conceptualization&#x2014;on thinking&#x2014;rather than formal process and methods. Both provocative and pragmatic, this book gives form to what&#x2019;s primarily been an oral tradition among the field&#x2019;s revolutionary thinkers&#x2014;and it illustrates specific object-behavior practices that you can adopt for true object design and superior results. </p> <p>Gain an in-depth understanding of:</p> <ul> <li>Prerequisites and principles of object thinking.</li> <li>Object knowledge implicit in eXtreme Programming (XP) and Agile software development.</li> <li>Object conceptualization and modeling.</li> <li>Metaphors, vocabulary, and design for object development.</li> </ul> <p>Learn viable techniques for:</p> <ul> <li>Decomposing complex domains in terms of objects.</li> <li>Identifying object relationships, interactions, and constraints.</li> <li>Relating object behavior to internal structure and implementation design.</li> <li>Incorporating object thinking into XP and Agile practice.</li></ul></p><p><p> <b>Dave West</b> would like to describe himself as sheik geek. Unfortunately no one else would describe him in that way.

In a single volume, the editors have compiled contributions that cover the history of psychoanalysis, the major theoretical models, and all facets of treatment and technique. This pluralistic approach is consistent with the conceptual and clinical diversity of contemporary American psychoanalysis, the focus of this newly revised work. The book also reflects the exponential increase in research activity within psychoanalysis, and the section on research is both up to date and substantive. Also current and extensive is the coverage of the interface between psychoanalysis and other disciplines, such as neuroscience. This interdisciplinary emphasis is one of the many strengths of this new edition. The editors have created a format that logically and painlessly educates and engages. No other volume offers the range of topics, the depth of coverage, or the accessible writing style of this groundbreaking text.</p><p>Glen O. Gabbard, M.D., is Professor of Psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York; Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas; and Training and Supervising Analyst at the Center for Psychoanalytic Studies in Houston, Texas. Bonnie E. Litowitz, Ph.D., is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Rush Medical School and is also on the faculty at the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. Paul Williams, Ph.D., is a training and supervising analyst with the British Psychoanalytical Society.It is quite possible that if given a choice of only one volume with which to spend a summer on a deserted island, this would be the one I d choose. The breadth of this compilation is tantamount to a summary text covering four years of analytic training seminars. It explores psychoanalysis roots, the history of its core concepts, both old and new, its emergent multiple schools of thought demonstrating their influence on both theory and technique, and finally the extraordinary importance of psychoanalysis to research, philosophy, gender studies, infant development and attachment theory, and finally, the arts. This book brings the psychoanalytic reader, whether neophyte or ancient traveler, up to date with many of the canon s greatest ideas. In so doing, it is an indispensable teaching tool. Bravo Gabbard, Litowitz, and Williams! --Philip A. Ringstrom, Ph.D., Psy.D., Training and Supervising Analyst at the Institute for Contemporary Psychoanalysis in Los Angeles, California<br><br>Philosopher of science Ludwi k Fleck classified the transmission of scientific knowledge into four types: journal science (shared by a professional group); handbook science (technical guides for carrying out practical procedures); popular science (for the general public); and textbook science (repositories of established current knowledge, used to teach and transmit that knowledge). Traditionally, textbooks have played a lesser role in psychoanalytic training as transmitters or encoders of the field's received wisdom than they have in other clinical fields. However, this volume will be an exception. The breadth of its subject matter and the diversity of backgrounds of its contributors not only captures but significantly expands the body of accepted psychoanalytic knowledge. It is not a volume to be kept on the shelf but deserves a place chairside for every psychoanalytic clinician, researcher, and contributor. Congratulations to the editors for their achievement. --Arnold Richards, M.D., Training and Supervising Analyst, New York Psychoanalytic Institute<br><br>The second edition of this renowned textbook makes it even more secure in its place as the outstanding overview of American psychoanalysis. Each chapter is written by an expert in its area, and Gabbard, Litowitz and Williams have done a remarkable job in ensuring the combination of comprehensiveness, depth of understanding, and readability. The book is more than a textbook. It is the single most complete and authoritative presentation of psychodynamics and psychoanalysis available. Everyone should have it on hand. --Sydney E.

There can also be an added, benefit: External recognition has a way of keeping pesky administrators at bay. It&#x2019;s hard for campus officials to criticize a newspaper when professionals have just named it one of the best in the state or the country. <br><br>As an adviser or editor, you can&#x2019;t make your newspaper win awards. But you can improve the staff&#x2019;s chances by creating a professional environment where students strive for excellence and do prize-worthy work. Here are some tips for helping your staff build an award-winning newspaper. <br><ol> <li><strong>Train. Train. Train.</strong> Training is essential. If your paper doesn't already have a comprehensive newsroom training program, create one. And if you already train your staff, add more training. Make sure your training program includes all aspects of the publication &#x2013; design, photography, online, writing, reporting and editing. Incorporate team-building and leadership-development exercises.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Take a stand.</strong> Contest judges have respect for bold, well-argued opinion pieces. Train your opinion writers to be fair and tasteful, respecting their sources and their readers, but also encourage them to fight &#x2013; and write &#x2013; for what they believe in. Teach students to back up a strongly worded opinion piece with facts to create a cogent and compelling argument. Share examples from the professional press, as well as other student newspapers, of well-written and effective editorials and columns.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Push projects.</strong> Encourage your staff to go beyond day-to-day coverage with special projects, series, special sections and enterprise stories. If a big story breaks on campus or an important issue is brewing, urge the staff to do an in-depth report. When you publish a project or special story, be sure to package it smartly with display type, graphics, sidebars and a logo that sets it apart.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Sweat the small stuff.</strong> Pay attention to details large and small. Misspelled words, headlines that don&#x2019;t make sense and punctuation errors can put you in the reject pile before you can say &#x201c;Oops!&#x201d;<br><br></li> <li><strong>Dare to be different.</strong> The professional press may not be able to afford to go out on a limb. You can. Experiment. Be bold.</li> </ol>Student newspaper production has greatly evolved since the first publication of this book in 2006, with increased emphasis on their Web sites, and many taking a Web-first approach to publishing news and incorporating multimedia storytelling. New delivery devices and technologies for transmitting breaking news now exist, such as microblogging and streaming video from cell phones. Social networking tools have created the opportunity to communicate with readers and to disseminate news in different ways.<br> <br> <p>This new edition of <i>The Student Newspaper Survival Guide</i> discusses how these rapid technological developments can positively affect the efficiency, effectiveness and creativity of student newspapers.

Wallace, author of <i>Causality and Scientific Explanation</i>This third edition of a distinguished book on the subject of causality is clear evidence that this principle continues to be an important area of philosophic enquiry.Non-technical and clearly written, this book focuses on the ontological problem of causality, with specific emphasis on the place of the causal principle in modern science. The author first defines the terminology employed and describes various formulations on the causal principle. He then examines the two primary critiques of causality, the empiricist and the romantic, as a prelude to the detailed explanation of the actual assertions of causal determination.

In <em>Managing Stage Fright: A Guide for Musicians and Music Teachers</em>, author Julie Jaffee Nagel unravels these mysteries, taking the reader on an intensive backstage tour of the anxious performer's emotions to explain why stage fright happens and what performers can do to increase their comfort in the glare of the spotlight. <br><br>Examining the topic from her interdisciplinary educational, theoretical, clinical, and personal perspectives, Nagel uses the music teacher/student relationship as a model for understanding the performance anxiety that affects musicians and non-musicians alike. Shedding new light on how the performer's emotional life is connected to every other facet of their life,<em> Managing Stage Fright</em> encourages a deeper understanding of anxiety when performing. The guide offers strategies for achieving performance confidence, emphasizing the relevance of mental health in teaching and performing. <br><br>Through the practices of self-awareness outlined in the book, Nagel demonstrates that it is possible and desirable for teachers to assist students in developing the coping skills and attitudes that will allow them to not feel overwhelmed and powerless when they experience strong anxiety. Each chapter contains insights that help teachers recognize the symptoms-obvious, subtle, and puzzling-of the emotional grip of stage fright, while offering practical guidelines that empower teachers to empower their students. The psychological concepts offered, when added to pedagogical techniques, are invaluable in music performance and in a variety of life situations since, after all, music lessons are life lessons.<br></p><p><br>Julie Jaffee Nagel, Ph.D. is a graduate of The Juilliard School, The University of Michigan and The Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute. The critically acclaimed author of <em>Melodies of the Mind</em>, she has drawn from over twenty years of multidisciplinary experience to shed light on performance anxiety as well as the important role of music in understanding a wide range of human emotions. She is also a regular contributor to Huffington Post and The Clavier Companion. She is in private practice in Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br><br>"Nagel's book is an extremely helpful guide to encouraging my students to perform with confidence...[The] volume is a very welcome addition to any personal library and will certainly help teachers and students understand the complex issue of performance anxiety.

Yet, within Russia, Putin&#x2019;s position remains unchallenged and his foreign policy battles have received widespread public support. But is Putin as safe as his approval ratings lead us to believe? And how secure is the regime that he heads? In this new book, Neil Robinson places contemporary Russian politics in historical perspective to argue that Putin&#x2019;s regime has not overcome the problems that underpinned the momentous changes in twentieth-century Russian history when the country veered from tsarism to Soviet rule to post-communist chaos.<br><br> The first part of the book, outlining why crises have been perennial problems for Russia, is followed by an exploration of contemporary Russian political institutions and policy to show how Putin has stabilised Russian politics. But, while Putin&#x2019;s achievements as a politician have been considerable in strengthening his personal position, they have not dealt successfully with the enduring problem of the Russian state&#x2019;s functionality. Like other Russian rulers, Putin has been much better at establishing a political system that supports his rule than he has at building up a state that can deliver material wealth and protection to the Russian people. As a result, Robinson argues, Russia has been and remains vulnerable to political crisis and regime change.</p><p><b>Neil Robinson</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Comparative Politics at the University of Limerick.<p>&#x201c;An up-to-date and analytically fresh perspective on the political development of post-Soviet Russia.<br>It should be required reading for all Russian politics courses.&#x201d;<br><b>Paul Chaisty, University of Oxford<br><br></b>&#x201c;Anyone seriously interested in understanding contemporary Russian politics should read this book. Combining<br>masterful synthesis of historical detail with original and cogent analysis, Robinson skilfully escorts the reader<br>through the opaque inner workings of the Russian political system. A welcome alternative to the usual fare of<br>shrill and shallow, Putin-obsessed texts, it will become a classroom standard.&#x201d;<br><b>Gerald M.

The impossible face-off between a whale and a polar bear. One was devised by Lautr�amont; the other punctuated by Freud. Both are memorable. Why so? They certainly tickle something in us. Lacan says what it is. It&#x2019;s about man and woman.<br><br> There is neither accord nor harmony between man and woman. There&#x2019;s no programme, nothing has been predetermined: every move is a shot in the dark, which in modal logic is called contingency. There&#x2019;s no way out of it. Why is it so inexorable, that is, so necessary? It really has to be reckoned that this stems from an impossibility. Hence the theorem: &#x201c;There is no sexual relation.&#x201d; The formula has become famous.<br><br> In the place of what thereby punctures a hole in the real, there is a plethora of luring and enchanting images, and there are discourses that prescribe what this relation must be. These discourses are mere semblance, the artifice of which psychoanalysis has made apparent to all. In the twenty-first century, this is beyond dispute. Who still believes that marriage has a natural foundation? Since it&#x2019;s a fact of culture, one devotes oneself to inventing. One cobbles together different constructions from whatever one can. It may be better ... or worse.<br><br> &#x201c;There is Oneness.&#x201d; At the heart of the present Seminar, this aphorism, which hitherto went unnoticed, complements the &#x201c;there is no&#x201d; of sexual relation, stating what there is. It should be heard as One-all-alone. Alone in jouissance (which is fundamentally auto-erotic) and alone in significance (outside any semantics). Here begins Lacan&#x2019;s late teaching. Everything he has already taught you is here, and yet everything is new, overhauled, topsy-turvy. <br><br>Lacan had taught the primacy of the Other in the order of truth and the order of desire. Here he teaches the primacy of the One in its real dimension. He rejects the Two of sexual relation and that of signifying articulation. He rejects the Big Other, the fulcrum of the dialectic of the subject, disputing its existence, which he consigns to fiction. He depreciates desire and promotes jouissance. He rejects Being, which is mere semblance. Henology, the doctrine of the One, here outclasses ontology, the theory of Being. What about the symbolic order? Nothing more than the reiteration of the One in the real. Hence the abandoning of graphs and topological surfaces in favour of knots made of rings of string, each of which is an unlinked One.<br><br> Recall that Seminar XVIII sighed for a discourse that would not be semblance. Well, with Seminar XIX, we have an attempt at a discourse that would take its point of departure in the real. The radical thought of modern Uni-dividualism.&#x2019;<b> <br><br>Jacques-Alain Miller</b></p><p><b>Jacques Lacan</b> (1901-1981) was one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most influential thinkers.

In the modern era, genocide has been a global phenomenon: from massacres in colonial America, Africa, and Australia to the Holocaust of European Jewry and mass death in Maoist China. In recent years, the discipline of 'genocide studies' has developed to offer analysis and comprehension.<br><br><em>The Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies</em> is the first book to subject both genocide and the young discipline it has spawned to systematic, in-depth investigation. Thirty-four renowned experts study genocide through the ages by taking regional, thematic, and disciplinary-specific approaches. Chapters examine secessionist and political genocides in modern Asia.

But while we have lost our faith in utopias of all hues, the human aspiration that made this vision so compelling has not died. Instead it is re-emerging today as a vision focused not on the future but on the past, not on a future-to-be-created but on an abandoned and undead past that we could call retrotopia.<br><br>The emergence of retrotopia is interwoven with the deepening gulf between power and politics that is a defining feature of our contemporary liquid-modern world&#x2015;the gulf between the ability to get things done and the capability of deciding what things need to be done, a capability once vested with the territorially sovereign state. This deepening gulf has rendered nation-states unable to deliver on their promises, giving rise to a widespread disenchantment with the idea that the future will improve the human condition and a mistrust in the ability of nation-states to make this happen. True to the utopian spirit, retrotopia derives its stimulus from the urge to rectify the failings of the present human condition&#x2015;though now by resurrecting the failed and forgotten potentials of the past. Imagined aspects of the past, genuine or putative, serve as the main landmarks today in drawing the road-map to a better world. Having lost all faith in the idea of building an alternative society of the future, many turn instead to the grand ideas of the past, buried but not yet dead. Such is retrotopia, the contours of which are examined by Zygmunt Bauman in this sharp dissection of our contemporary romance with the past.</p></p><p><b>Zygmunt Bauman</b> (1925-2017) was Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Leeds.</p><h2>Chebyshev and Fourier Spectral Methods: Second Revised Edition (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>Completely revised text focuses on use of spectral methods to solve boundary value, eigenvalue, and time-dependent problems, but also covers Hermite, Laguerre, rational Chebyshev, sinc, and spherical harmonic functions, as well as cardinal functions, linear eigenvalue problems, matrix-solving methods, coordinate transformations, methods for unbounded intervals, spherical and cylindrical geometry, and much more. 7 Appendices.

This text provides readers with the basic information needed to be knowledgeable distance educators and leaders of distance education programs. The teacher or trainer who uses this book will be able to distinguish between appropriate uses of distance education. In this text we take the following themes: The first theme is the definition of distance education. Before we started writing the first edition of Teaching and Learning at a Distance we carefully reviewed the literature to determine the definition that would be at the foundation of our writing. This definition is based on the work of Desmond Keegan, but is unique to this book. This definition of distance education has been adopted by the Association for Educational Communications and Technology and by the Encyclopedia Britannica. The second theme of the book was the importance of research to the development of the contents of the book. The best practices presented in Teaching and Learning at a Distance are validated by scientific evidence. Certainly there are &#34;rules of thumb&#34;, but we have always attempted to only include recommendations that can be supported by research. The third theme of Teaching and Learning at a distance is derived from Richard Clark&#39;s famous quote published in the Review of Educational Research that states that media are mere vehicles that do not directly influence achievement. Clark&#39;s controversial work is discussed in the book, but is also fundamental to the book&#39;s advocacy for distance education - in other words, we authors did not make the claim that education delivered at a distance was inherently better than other ways people learn. Distance delivered instruction is not a &#34;magical&#34; approach that makes learners achieve more. The fourth theme of the book is equivalency theory. Here we presented the concept that instruction should be provided to learners that is equivalent rather than identical to what might be delivered in a traditional environment. Equivalency theory helps the instructional designer approach the development of instruction for each learner without attempting to duplicate what happens in a face to face classroom. The final theme for Teaching and Learning at a Distance is the idea that the book should be comprehensive - that it should cover as much of the various ways instruction is made available to distant learners as is possible. It should be a single source of information about the field.</p><p>Michael Simonson, Nova Southeastern University, USASharon Smaldino, Northern Illinois University, USASusan M.

But how democratic is our own "democracy"? If you can vote, if the majority rules, if you have elected representatives--does this automatically mean that you have a democracy? In this eye-opening look at an ideal that we all take for granted, classical scholar Paul Woodruff offers some surprising answers to these questions.<br> Drawing on classical literature, philosophy, and history--with many intriguing passages from Sophocles, Aesop, and Plato, among others--Woodruff immerses us in the world of ancient Athens to uncover how the democratic impulse first came to life. The heart of the book isolates seven conditions that are the <em>sine qua non</em> of democracy: freedom from tyranny , harmony, the rule of law, natural equality, citizen wisdom, reasoning without knowledge, and general education. He concludes that a true democracy must be willing to invite everyone to join in government. It must respect the rule of law so strongly that even the government is not above the law. True democracy must be mature enough to accept changes that come from the people. And it must be willing to pay the price of education for thoughtful citizenship. If we learn anything from the story of Athens, Woodruff concludes, it should be this--never lose sight of the ideals of democracy. This compact, eloquent book illuminates these ideals and lights the way as we struggle to keep democracy alive at home and around the world.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul Woodruff</strong> is Darrel K.

It's a heartfelt story of the birth, life and death of real democracy in ancient Athens and, by implication, its country cousin in America. Woodruff distills the essence of authentic democracy and conveys that to us through a compelling narration. He subtly compares how modern American democracy has collapsed, as did Athens, because of imperial overreach and betrayal of democratic ideals by ambitious elites. He correctly concludes, with a fervent hope, that America's future salvation lies in finding a way to be true to Athens at its best." --Ted Becker, Alumni Professor of Political Science, Auburn University<p></p><br>"This elegant essay from a distinguished classicist raises fundamental questions relevant to our contemporary political life through the prism of the Athenian democracy.

By bringing community members to the table, we open up the possibility of exchanging ideas meaningfully and transforming places powerfully. Collaboration like this is hands-on democracy in action. It&#x2019;s up close. It&#x2019;s personal. For decades, participatory design practices have helped enliven neighborhoods and promote cultural understanding. Yet, many designers still rely on the same techniques that were developed in the 1950s and 60s. These approaches offer predictability, but hold waning promise for addressing current and future design challenges. <i>Design as Democracy: Techniques for Collective Creativity</i> is written to reinvigorate democratic design, providing inspiration, techniques, and case stories for a wide range of contexts.<br><br> Edited by six leading practitioners and academics in the field of participatory design, with nearly 50 contributors from around the world, <i>Design as Democracy</i> shows how to design with communities in empowering and effective ways. The flow of the book&#x2019;s nine chapters reflects the general progression of community design process, while also encouraging readers to search for ways that best serve their distinct needs and the culture and geography of diverse places. Each chapter presents a series of techniques around a theme, from approaching the initial stages of a project, to getting to know a community, to provoking political change through strategic thinking. Readers may approach the book as they would a cookbook, with recipes open to improvisation, adaptation, and being created anew.<br><br><i>Design as Democracy</i> offers fresh insights for creating meaningful dialogue between designers and communities and for transforming places with justice and democracy in mind.</p><p>This contributed volume offers techniques for bringing justice and democracy into community design&nbsp;<br>David de la Pe�a is an architect, urban designer and Assistant Professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of California, Davis.

It brings together an international and interdisciplinary group of scholars to address the medical, social, political, and economic dimensions of the global health enterprise through vivid case studies and bold conceptual work. The book demonstrates the crucial role of ethnography as an empirical lantern in global health, arguing for a more comprehensive, people-centered approach.</p><br><p> Topics include the limits of technological quick fixes in disease control, the moral economy of global health science, the unexpected effects of massive treatment rollouts in resource-poor contexts, and how right-to-health activism coalesces with the increased influence of the pharmaceutical industry on health care. The contributors explore the altered landscapes left behind after programs scale up, break down, or move on. We learn that disease is really never just one thing, technology delivery does not equate with care, and biology and technology interact in ways we cannot always predict. The most effective solutions may well be found in people themselves, who consistently exceed the projections of experts and the medical-scientific, political, and humanitarian frameworks in which they are cast.</p><br><br><p> <i>When People Come First</i> sets a new research agenda in global health and social theory and challenges us to rethink the relationships between care, rights, health, and economic futures.</p></p><p><p>"Rapid social change is the one constant in this ambitious volume.

The slave woman struggled to avoid an unwanted husband and the woman of privilege assumed a patriarch&#39;s role to endow a family of her former slaves with the means for a free life. Sandra Lauderdale Graham casts new light on larger meanings of slave and free, female and male, through these compact histories.</p><p>Here are the true and dramatic stories of two nineteenth-century Brazilian women--one young and born a slave, the other old and from an illustrious planter family--and how each in her own way sought to have her way: the slave woman struggled to avoid an unwanted husband; the woman of privilege assumed a patriarch&#39;s role to endow a family of her former slaves with the means for a free life. Through these small histories Lauderdale Graham casts new light on larger meanings of slave and free, female and male."Two women, different roles, both shaking the structures of established male authority through the intransigence of their personal moral decisions. In this marvelous book Lauderdale Graham retrieves two sinuous stories from ecclesiastical and legal archives, and through their close analysis lays bare the stresses, ambivalences and the surprising elasticity of the slave system as practiced in a river valley in southeastern Brazil during the middle decades of the nineteenth-century. 'Brazilian Slavery' will never look the same again." Inga Clendinnen, Reader in History Emeritus at La Trobe University<br><br>"Caetana is a finely crafted book on women's lives under patriarchal planters. Readers will appreciate the author's vivid descriptions and analysis of typical Brazilian social customs and gender roles of the nineteenth century. The short length of the book combined with photographs will make this especially attractive for classroom use." The Americas<br><br>"This is a fascinating study of gender, slavery and patriarchy, written from the perspective of two remarkable, and at the same time so different, women. It combines imaginative research, engaging narrative, and solid thinking, opening a resonant new perspective on the historiography of nineteenth-century Brazil." Joao Jose Reis, Universidade Federal da Bahia<br><br>"Sandra Lauderdale Graham's lucidly written and meticulously researched study of women in a slave society calls to mind novelist L.P. Hartley's observation that "the past is a foreign country:they do things differently there." A fascinating read set in the expanding coffee economy of nineteenth-century Brazil, this book links the lives of two women, Caetana and Inacia, who chose to act in ways that subtly challenged the men who held power in their lives. By piecing together their lives and choices, Lauderdale Graham vividly and memorably depicts the complex and competing intersections of gender, race, family, and property that characterized Brazilian slavery." Alida C. Metcalf, Trinity University<br><br>"By exploring two mysteries that can't be fully solved, by puzzling over small kindnesses and betrayals in two plantation households, we learn the grammar of rules and exceptions that made up Brazil's nineteenth-century system. These women's predicaments show us the flexible harshness of whimsical, 'cordial' domination in agrarian Brazil." Dain Borges, University of Chicago<br><br>"Graham has given us a wonderfully insightful glimpse into the history of women in postcolonial Brazil.... This is one of the most lucid and welcome additions to the literature on the subject published in recent years. Highly recommended."

As Trevor-Roper explains in his preface, "the crisis in government, society, and ideas which occurred, both in Europe and in England, between the Reformation and the middle of the seventeenth century" constituted the crucible for what "went down in the general social and intellectual revolution of the mid-seventeenth century." The Civil War, the Restoration, and the Glorious Revolution in England laid the institutional and intellectual foundations of the modern understanding of liberty, of which we are heirs and beneficiaries. Trevor-Roper's essays uncover new pathways to understanding this seminal time.</p> <p>In his longest essay, "The European Witch-craze of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," Trevor-Roper points out that "In England the most active phase of witch-hunting coincided with times of Puritan pressure&#x2014;the reign of Queen Elizabeth and the period of the civil wars&#x2014;and some very fanciful theories have been built on this coincidence. But . . . the persecution of witches in England was trivial compared with the experience of the Continent and of Scotland. Therefore . . . [one must examine] the craze as a whole, throughout Europe, and [seek] to relate its rise, frequency, and decline to the general intellectual and social movements of the time. . . ."

The individuals started to band together informally, joined initially by their enthusiasm for Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose campaign. They self-mockingly called the 19th Street row house in which they congregated the "House of Truth," playing off the lively dinner discussions with frequent guest (and neighbor) Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. about life's verities. Lippmann and Frankfurter were house-mates, and their frequent guests included not merely Holmes but Louis Brandeis, Herbert Hoover, Herbert Croly - founder of the <em>New Republic</em> - and the sculptor (and sometime Klansman) Gutzon Borglum, later the creator of the Mount Rushmore monument. <br><br>Weaving together the stories and trajectories of these varied, fascinating, combative, and sometimes contradictory figures, Brad Snyder shows how their thinking about government and policy shifted from a firm belief in progressivism - the belief that the government should protect its workers and regulate monopolies - into what we call liberalism - the belief that government can improve citizens' lives without abridging their civil liberties and, eventually, civil rights. Holmes replaced Roosevelt in their affections and aspirations. His famous dissents from 1919 onward showed how the Due Process clause could protect not just business but equality under the law, revealing how a generally conservative and reactionary Supreme Court might embrace, even initiate, political and social reform. <br><br>Across the years, from 1912 until the start of the New Deal in 1933, the remarkable group of individuals associated with the House of Truth debated the future of America. They fought over Sacco and Vanzetti's innocence; the dangers of Communism; the role the United States should play the world after World War One; and thought dynamically about things like about minimum wage, child-welfare laws, banking insurance, and Social Security, notions they not only envisioned but worked to enact. American liberalism has no single source, but one was without question a row house in Dupont Circle and the lives that intertwined there at a crucial moment in the country's history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Brad Snyder </strong>teaches constitutional law, civil procedure, twentieth century American legal history, and sports law at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

Adams presents a major work on virtue, which is once again a central topic in ethical thought. A Theory of Virtue is a systematic, comprehensive framework for thinking about the moral evaluation of character. Many recent attempts to stake out a place in moral philosophy for this concern define virtue in terms of its benefits for the virtuous person or for human society more generally. In Part One Adams presents and defends a conception of virtue as intrinsic excellence of character, worth prizing for its own sake and not only for its benefits. In the other two parts he addresses two challenges to the ancient idea of excellence of character. One challenge arises from the importance of altruism in modern ethical thought, and the question of what altruism has to do with intrinsic excellence. Part Two argues that altruistic benevolence does indeed have a crucial place in excellence of character, but that moral virtue should also be expected to involve excellence in being for other goods besides the well-being (and the rights) of other persons. It explores relations among cultural goods, personal relationships, one&#39;s own good, and the good of others, as objects of excellent motives. The other challenge, the subject of Part Three of the book, is typified by doubts about the reality of moral virtue, arising from experiments and conclusions in social psychology. Adams explores in detail the prospects for an empirically realistic conception of excellence of character as an object of moral aspiration, endeavor, and education. He argues that such a conception will involve renunciation of the ancient thesis of the unity or mutual implication of all virtues, and acknowledgment of sufficient &#39;moral luck&#39; in the development of any individual&#39;s character to make virtue very largely a gift, rather than an individual achievement, though nonetheless excellent and admirable for that.</p><p><br><strong>Robert Merrihew Adams</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Mansfield College, University of Oxford<br>"Robert Adams's new book is an important and comprehensive contribution to the study of virtue and to the defense of its existence.

The authors have included over thirty narratives from victims, offenders, and professionals working within the system. These personal narratives provide real-life examples of how crime and the criminal justice system are experienced.<br><br>The experiences of real people are often lost in discussions about criminal justice processes and the criminal justice system in general. Texts and teaching too frequently focus exclusively on criminal justice procedures or on macro-level systems. Such conversations lose sight of and de-value the impact of systems on individuals. This textbook seeks to provide the human voice to the topic of criminal justice, while also providing all of the relevant materials to introductory classes. Built around the narratives are all of the traditional materials that instructors need to cover in introduction to criminal justice courses. However, since a good portion of the text will be powerful narratives written by those who have lived and performed in the criminal justice domain, this book represents an innovative approach that simultaneously challenges instructors to think about their pedagogy in new ways, potentially making their classroom encounters more lively and compelling.</p><p>Alissa Ackerman is an Assistant Professor teaching Criminal Justice in the Department of Social Work at the University of Washington, Tacoma.

It reconstructs a trajectory of thought from an Organic condition of thinking elaborated by Kant, passing by the philosophy of nature (Schelling and Hegel), to the 20th century Organicism (Bertalanffy, Needham, Whitehead, Wiener among others) and Organology (Bergson, Canguilhem, Simodnon, Stiegler), and questions the new condition of philosophizing in the time of algorithmic contingency, ecological and algorithmic catastrophes, which Heidegger calls the end of philosophy.<br><br>The book centres on the following speculative question: if in the philosophical tradition, the concept of contingency is always related to the laws of nature, then in what way can we understand contingency in related to technical systems? The book situates the concept of recursivity as a break from the Cartesian mechanism and the drive of system construction; it elaborates on the necessity of contingency in such epistemological rupture where nature ends and system emerges. In this development, we see how German idealism is precursor to cybernetics, and the Anthropocene and Noosphere (Teilhard de Chardin) point toward the realization of a gigantic cybernetic system, which lead us back to the question of freedom. It questions the concept of absolute contingency (Meillassoux) and proposes a cosmotechnical pluralism. Engaging with modern and contemporary European philosophy as well as Chinese thought through the mediation of Needham, this book refers to cybernetics, mathematics, artificial intelligence and inhumanism.</p><p>Yuk Hui is the author of On the Existence of Digital Objects (University of Minnesota Press, 2016) and The Question Concerning Technology in China. An Essay in Cosmotechnics (Urbanomic, 2017).<p>Recursivity and Contingency is simply an outstanding philosophical treatise on cybernetics that re-opens the all-too human image of technology today. Alongside a zealous re-situating of system theory within philosophies of nature, Hui boldly defies current technocratic aspirations towards totalizing and deterministic systems with a metaphysical commitment to re-envision the relation with the inhuman. Cosmotechnical perspectives, alter-cosmologies, and techno-diversity are here part of human-machine genesis that promises to finally re-situate technology in various cosmic realities. (Luciana Parisi, Reader in Cultural Theory, Goldsmiths, University of London)<br><br>I hardly know how best to recommend this third major achievement in as many years by one of the most insightful younger philosophers. It reanimates an abandoned arc of reflection that includes cybernetics, organicism, and organology from both European and Chinese traditions to address aspirations for a pluralism of homes within the becoming of an artificial Earth. (Carl Mitcham, Professor of Liberal Arts and International Studies, Colorado School of Mines)<br><br>Yuk Hui&#x2019;s rich, new writing shows that in order to understand our modern technological world, we need to understand modern thinking about organisms and organology &#x2013; and not only to understand but, recursively, to think differently. Hui&#x2019;s cosmotechnical approach &#x2013; from cybernetics to history of philosophy &#x2013; is complex, and exactly because of that, deeply rewarding. (Jussi Parikka, Professor in Technological Culture and Aesthetics, University of Southampton)<br><br>Yuk Hui's Recursivity and Contingency is not simply a major contribution to the Philosophy of Technology &#x2013; it is an immense resource in that respect &#x2013; but it is also a lively work of pluralistic experiment in thought. Here Hui's invitation to think in terms of cosmotechnics comes into its full bloom, engineering an unsurpassably agile guide to questions of technology and culture, nature and mechanism, logic and existence as they have arisen before and as they manifest with full force in the present.<br><br> (Matthew Fuller, Professor of Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths, University of London)</p></p><h2>Orthodox Readings of Aquinas (Changing Paradigms in Historical and Systematic Theology)</h2><p>This book is the first exploration of the remarkable odyssey of Thomas Aquinas in the Orthodox Christian world, from the Byzantine to the modern era. Aquinas was received with astonishing enthusiasm across the Byzantine theological spectrum. By contrast, modern Orthodox readings of Aquinas have been resoundingly negative, routinely presenting Aquinas as the archetype of as a specifically Western form of theology against which the Orthodox East must set its face. Basing itself primarily on a close study of the Byzantine reception of Thomas, this study rejects such hackneyed dichotomies, arguing instead for a properly catholic or universal construal of Orthodoxy - one in which Thomas might once again find a place. In its probing of the East-West dichotomy, this book questions the widespread juxtaposition of Gregory Palamas and Thomas Aquinas as archetypes of opposing Greek and Latin theological traditions. The long period between the Fall of Constantinople and the Russian Revolution, conventionally written off as an era of sterility and malformation for Orthodox theology, is also viewed with a fresh perspective. Study of the reception of Thomas in this period reveals a theological sophistication and a generosity of vision that is rarely accounted for. In short, this is a book which radically re-thinks the history of Orthodox theology through the prism of the fascinating and largely untold story of Orthodox engagement with Aquinas.<br></p><p><br><strong>Marcus Plested</strong> has taught, lectured, and published widely in the field of Orthodox Christian studies.

In fact, most cities claim to be compiled of neighborhoods, but this strays far from the term's original meaning - a spatial unit that people relate to. <br><br>Neighborhood seeks to dispel this common misconception by integrating a complex historical record and multidisciplinary literature to produce a singular resource for understanding what is meant by neighborhood. Emily Talen provides a multi-dimensional, comprehensive view of what neighborhoods signify how they're idealized and measured, and what their historical progression has been. Talen balances perspectives from sociology, urban history, urban planning, and sustainability among others in efforts to make neighborhoods compatible with 21st century ideals.<br><br>If neighborhoods are going to play a role in the future of the city, we need to know what and where they are in a more meaningful way.

Teaford, author of <em>City and Suburb: The Political Fragmentation of Metropolitan America, 1850-1970</em><p></p><br>"Everyone loves neighborhoods, but few of us get to live in places that genuinely combine human scale, walkability, sociability, and diversity. Emily Talen brings deep scholarship to the task of analyzing the century-long struggle by planners to understand and to design neighborhoods. More importantly, she brings her own unique sense of hope.

Her innovative approach makes possible a new understanding of the unity of the book of Job; she rejects the dismantling of the book by historical criticism and the flattening of the text that characterizes certain final form readings.<br></p><p><br>Charles Howard Candler Professor of Old Testament at Emory University's Candler School of Theology. She has written and edited several books, and is co-editor of The Oxford Annotated Bible .<br><br>"This book offers an insightful reading of Job and conceptually advances the understanding of modes of expression of Iraelite religious thought." --<em>Old Testament Abstracts</em><p></p><br>"This approach results in a extraordinary reading of Job, both methodologically and substantively. Newsom does not pretend to resolve all the interpretive cruxes, but to put the conversation on a firm footing, and she succeeds admirably.... readers who engage Job under her guidance will find themselves grappling indirectly with its moral and even its pastoral implications. This is the kind of interpretation that gets to the heart of the matter and makes a real difference--criticism in the best sense of the word."--<em>Anglican Theological Review</em><p></p><br>"Carol Newsom's magnificent analysis of the book of Job from the perspective of modern hermeneutics, and propelled by the theme of the moral imagination, is destined to become a classic. Her deft handling of the interpretive tradition, her choice of guides--e.g., Mikhail Bakhtin, Wayne Booth, Emmanuel Levinas, Paul Ricoeur, Martha Nussbaum, Alasdair MacIntyre--and her engagement with the biblical text in all its complexity are a joy to behold."--James L. Crenshaw, Robert L. Flowers Professor of the Old Testament, <em>Duke University</em><p></p><br>"Carol Newsom's study of Job is an insightful and provocative reading of that most difficult of biblical books. By combining literary-critical and postmodern methodologies, she significantly advances our interpretation of the book of Job, solving many problems that earlier treatments have not. This is a major and substantial contribution, lucid in both argument and style. Future work on Job will have to begin where Newsom leaves off." --Michael D. Coogan, Editor, <em>The New Oxford Annotated Bible, The Oxford History of the Biblical World,</em> and <em>The Oxford Companion to the Bible</em><p></p><br>"Carol Newsom's new book raises the level of discourse on the discourse of the Book of Job to a higher plane. Rarely has such literary sophistication been applied to a Biblical text with such clarity and moment. We are led to read the different parts of Job and the different voices given expression within them in dialogue with each other, without privileging one over the other. Drawing (ever critically) on the work of Bakhtin and several other theorists and critics, Newsom makes a powerful argument for an active reading of Job that is intensely engaged both textually and morally. No serious reader of Job will pass over Newsom's book, and no reader of the book will ever be the same. Readers may well find it, as I did, a milestone in their education. A tour de force and a major contribution to Biblical interpretation."--Edward L. Greenstein, Professor of Bible, <em>Tel Aviv University</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The De Soto Chronicles: The Expedition of Hernando de Soto to North America in 1539-1543 (Two Volume Set)</h2><p><p>1993 Choice Outstanding Academic Book, sponsored by Choice Magazine.<br><br>The De Soto expedition was the first major encounter of Europeans with North American Indians in the eastern half of the United States.

At the national or the local level there are ministries or departments of public health, whilst international agencies such as the World Health Organization promote public health policies, and regional organizations such as the European Union have public health funding and policies. But what do we mean when we speak about "public health?" <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Virginia Berridge explores the areas which fall under the remit of public health, and explains how the individual histories of different countries have come to cause great differences in the perception of the role and responsibilities of public health organizations. Thus, in the United States litigation on public health issues is common, but state involvement is less, while some Scandinavian countries have a tradition of state involvement or even state ownership of industries such as alcohol in connection with public health. In its narrowest sense, public health can refer to the health of a population, the longevity of individual members, and their freedom from disease, but it can also be anticipatory, geared to the prevention of illness, rather than simply the provision of care and treatment. In the way public health deals with healthy as well as sick people it is therefore a separate concept from health services, which deal with the sick population. Drawing on a wide range of international examples, Berridge demonstrates the central role of history to understanding the amorphous nature of public health today.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

In such experiments, quantum mechanical computations do two useful tasks: They fill in the observational gaps and help to interpret what has been observed.<br>This introductory course &#x2014; developed by the former chairman of the chemistry department at the University of New Hampshire &#x2014; covers, among other topics, the origins of the quantum theory, the Schr�dinger wave equation, the quantum mechanics of simple systems, the rigid rotator, the hydrogen atom, electron spin and many-electron systems, the quantum states of atoms, the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method, the electronic structure of molecules, and semi-empirical molecular orbital methods. One of the great values of the course is its calculations and diagrams, which were created specifically for this text and which students will be able to replicate on their home computers.<br>The text will be most useful for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students who have had calculus and at least a year of undergraduate physics. A knowledge of differential equations, linear algebra, and atomic physics is helpful but not essential.

Why is it important for teachers to understand the differences? How can educators take advantage of students cultural traits to improve classroom management, student performance, and school-parent relations? Carrie Rothstein-Fisch and Elise Trumbull answer these and many other questions by drawing on the experience and collective wisdom of teachers in the Bridging Cultures Project, a five-year action research study of elementary classrooms with high percentages of immigrant students. <br> The authors present a simple framework for understanding cultural differences, comparing the individualistic culture that prevails in American education with the collectivistic culture that characterizes most of the world s population, including many of the Latino immigrant students in U.S. classrooms. At the heart of the book are teacher-developed strategies that capitalize on the cultural values that these students and their families offer, such as an emphasis on helping, sharing, and the success of the group. The strategies cover a wide spectrum of issues and concerns, including <br> * Communication with families<br> * Open house and parent-teacher conferences<br> * Homework<br> * Attendance<br> * Learning in the content areas<br> * Motivation and rewards<br> * Classroom rules<br> * Assessment and grading<br>Managing Diverse Classrooms: How to Build on Students Cultural Strengths presents both the research foundation and the practical perspectives of seasoned teachers whose classroom-tested approaches have produced positive results.

This time is a period of curiosity and openness to learning. The thinking habits and study skills acquired by children at this age stay with them for a lifetime. Mathematical circles, with their question-driven approach and emphasis on creative problem-solving, have been rapidly gaining popularity in the United States. The circles expose children to the type of mathematics that stimulates development of logical thinking, creativity, analytical abilities and mathematical reasoning. These skills, while scarcely touched upon at school, are in high demand in the modern world. This book contains everything that is needed to run a successful mathematical circle for a full year. The materials, distributed among 29 weekly lessons, include detailed lectures and discussions, sets of problems with solutions, and contests and games. In addition, the book shares some of the know-how of running a mathematical circle. The curriculum, which is based on the rich and long-standing Russian math circle tradition, has been modified and adapted for teaching in the United States. For the past decade, the author has been actively involved in teaching a number of mathematical circles in the Seattle area. This book is based on her experience and on the compilation of materials from these circles. The material is intended for students in grades 5 to 7. It can be used by teachers and parents with various levels of expertise who are interested in teaching mathematics with the emphasis on critical thinking. Also, this book will be of interest to mathematically motivated children. In the interest of fostering a greater awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and everyday life, MSRI and the AMS are publishing books in the Mathematical Circles Library series as a service to young people, their parents and teachers, and the mathematics profession. Titles in this series are co-published with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI).</p><p></p><h2>Getting Started in Fundamental Analysis</h2><p>If you've picked up this book, you probably recognize the value of fundamental analysis, but aren't sure you can master it.

Mertens, this book provides a framework for making methodological decisions and conducting research and evaluations that promote social justice. The transformative paradigm has emerged from&#x2014;and guides&#x2014;a broad range of social and behavioral science research projects with communities that have been pushed to the margins, such as ethnic, racial, and sexual minority group members and children and adults with disabilities. Mertens shows how to formulate research questions based on community needs, develop researcher&#x2013;community partnerships grounded in trust and respect, and skillfully apply quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods data collection strategies. Practical aspects of analyzing and reporting results are addressed, and numerous sample studies are presented. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Student- and Instructors-Friendly Features Include:</p><p>*Commentary on the sample studies that explains what makes them transformative.</p><p>*Explanations of key concepts related to oppression, social justice, and the role of research and evaluation.</p><p>*Questions for Thought to stimulate critical self-reflection and discussion.</p><p>*Advance chapter organizers and chapter summaries.</p></p><p><p><b>Donna M. Mertens </b>is Professor in the Department of Educational Foundations and Research at Gallaudet University, where she teaches advanced research methods and program evaluation to deaf and hearing students. She received the Distinguished Faculty Award from Gallaudet in 2007. The primary focus of her work is transformative mixed-methods inquiry in diverse communities that prioritizes ethical implications of research in pursuit of social justice. A past president of the American Evaluation Association (AEA), Dr. Mertens provided leadership in the development of the International Organization for Cooperation in Evaluation and the establishment of the AEA Diversity Internship Program with Duquesne University. She received AEA&#x2019;s highest honor for service to the organization and the field.

I've just finished reading this book, and I think it is terrific! It is just right for a course in which students will be engaging in community-university partnerships as well as learning to think critically about research."--Robb Travers, PhD, Department of Psychology, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada</p>"As the world becomes more interconnected and diverse, our research methods need to keep up with changes. Mertens writes beautifully about conducting research in the service of social justice, using a transformative lens and focusing clearly on each step in the process. This book illustrates why Mertens is so highly regarded for her writing that links research methods theory with practice. I highly recommend this book for researchers and graduate students across the social and human sciences."--John W. Creswell, Department of Educational Psychology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln<p>"Mertens focuses on using research and evaluation to transform people&#x2019;s lives and communities. Including historically excluded and marginalized people in the processes of generating and using knowledge is transformative not only for research participants, but also for the researchers and evaluators who engage with them. The genius of Mertens's comprehensive approach resides in the way she makes transformative inquiry accessible and inclusive yet intellectually robust and methodologically rigorous. She invites us into the transformative process, changing the ways we both think about and conduct research and evaluation. This book is for anyone open to seriously engaging the transformative power of inclusive inquiry."--Michael Q. Patton, author of <i>Utilization-Focused Evaluation, Fourth Edition</i></p><p>"Mertens gets to the heart of how to ground research and evaluation projects in a social justice framework, in line with multiple disciplinary perspectives that embrace a transformative paradigm. This book will challenge students--including those who have not previously questioned their basic societal beliefs and assumptions--to explore diversity and oppression issues in new ways. I appreciated the inclusion of truly diverse groups, including ethnocultural minority groups and others, in the discussions of the various research and evaluation projects. The international examples and perspectives were very refreshing, too."--Gary W. Harper, Department of Psychology, DePaul University </p><p>"With the increase in awareness of diversity, a book like this one is long overdue. This is the first book I have read that comprehensively discusses how to approach evaluation using strategies that are culturally appropriate and inclusive of diverse communities. Mertens provides a holistic and inclusive way of thinking about research methodology. She does a wonderful job of explaining the transformative paradigm in lay language."--Katrina L. Bledsoe, Associate Project Director, Walter R. McDonald &amp; Associates, Washington, DC</p><p>"This important book assembles the complex array of procedures, perspectives, and priorities associated with transformative research and evaluation. It blends the many voices and illustrations available in the literature to assist the reader in identifying what is possible in this important new paradigm. Significant cross-cultural and international examples of studies that truly warrant the label of 'transformative' are incorporated."--Melvin E. Hall, Department of Educational Psychology, Northern Arizona University</p><br><br>"This is the first book that specifically addresses research methodology for the transformative perspective....Although the book prioritizes an educational focus, it has relevance beyond education and scholars from management disciplines can add a practical and penetrating reading to their research toolbox....The audience encompasses novice researchers and evaluators, advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, more experienced teachers and evaluators....This book reminds us all that social research is embedded within a system of values and the myth of objective and value-free research should be discharged.

In this society we are all expected, rightly or wrongly, to give our lives purpose and form by using our own skills and resources, even if we lack the tools and materials with which artists' studios need to be equipped for the artist's work to be conceived and executed. And we are praised or censured for the results - for what we have managed or failed to accomplish and for what we have achieved and lost. <br> In our liquid modern society we are also taught to believe that the purpose of the art of life should be and can be happiness - though it's not clear what happiness is, the images of a happy state keep changing and the state of happiness remains most of the time something yet-to-be-reached. <br> <br> This new book by Zygmunt Bauman - one of the most original and influential social thinkers writing today - is not a book of designs for the art of life nor a 'how to' book: the construction of a design for life and the way it is pursued is and cannot but be an individual responsibility and individual accomplishment. It is instead a brilliant account of conditions under which our designs-for-life are chosen, of the constraints that might be imposed on their choice and of the interplay of design, accident and character that shape their implementation. Last but not least, it is a study of the ways in which our society - the liquid modern, individualized society of consumers - influences (but does not determine) the way we construct and narrate our life trajectories.</p><p><b>Zygmunt Bauman </b> (1925-2017) was Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the Universities of Warsaw and Leeds."Brilliant ... To be read while listening to the Manic Street Preachers."<br><b>Steven Poole, <i>The Guardian<br><br></i></b>"An insightful reflection on the pursuit of happiness - that state to which we are all conditioned to aspite - as well as what's wrong with the 'designs for life' we pursue in order to attain it ... Reading this definitely made me reconsider my own priorities."<br><i><b>Frieze</b></i></p><h2>Sex, Politics, and Putin: Political Legitimacy in Russia (Oxford Studies in Culture and Politics)</h2><p>Is Vladimir Putin macho, or is he a "fag"? <em>Sex, Politics, and Putin</em> investigates how gender stereotypes and sexualization have been used as tools of political legitimation in contemporary Russia. Despite their enmity, regime allies and detractors alike have wielded traditional concepts of masculinity, femininity, and homophobia as a means of symbolic endorsement or disparagement of political leaders and policies. <br><br>By repeatedly using machismo as a means of legitimation, Putin's regime (unlike that of Gorbachev or Yeltsin) opened the door to the concerted use of gendered rhetoric and imagery as a means to challenge regime authority. <em>Sex, Politics, and Putin</em> analyzes the political uses of gender norms and sexualization in Russia through three case studies: pro- and anti-regime groups' activism aimed at supporting or undermining the political leaders on their respective sides; activism regarding military conscription and patriotism; and feminist activism. Arguing that gender norms are most easily invoked as tools of authority-building when there exists widespread popular acceptance of misogyny and homophobia, Sperling also examines the ways in which sexism and homophobia are reflected in Russia's public sphere.<br></p><p><br>Valerie Sperling is Professor of Political Science at Clark University. She is the author of <em>Altered States: The Globalization of Accountability</em> and <em>Organizing Women in Contemporary Russia: Engendering Transition.</em><br><br>"[T]he combination of a strong conceptual grounding and analytical framework makes <em>Sex, Politics, and Putin</em> a robust and engaging example of what Area Studies can be at its best and a volume that will interest scholars of both gender and politics and Russian Studies. It works for both advanced undergraduate and postgraduate courses in these fields and for courses on gender and sexuality more widely given the almost universal salience of the topic and the persuasiveness of Sperling's analysis and conclusions." -- Cai Wilkinson, <em>Global Discourse</em><p></p><br>"Valerie Sperling provides a valuable and comprehensive examination of the use of gender norms in Russian politics. Sperling goes well beyond the ubiquitous imagery of a half-naked Putin on horseback or the scantily clad 'Medvedev Girls' in arguing that gendered structures of legitimation affect regime and opposition in equal measures...Sperling's careful analysis and lively prose should serve as a valuable introduction for students of gender politics, as well as a helpful corrective for seasoned observers of Russian politics who downplay the significance of gendered norms as an interesting sideshow." <br>--<em>The Russian Review</em><p></p><br>"<em>Sex, Politics, and Putin</em> is not only one of the most important books on gender politics in Russia, but on Russian politics more generally. It makes the case that norms of masculinity and patriarchy constitute an important element in the legitimation of Vladimir Putin's rule in Russia and that opposition forces employ the very same set of norms in their efforts to undercut the regime's dominance. Anyone who wants to understand Russian politics should read this book." --Henry E. Hale, George Washington University <br><p></p><br>"Accessibly, even humorously written, this account of recent Russian politics offers vivid insights into the broader domain of manipulating perceptions of sexuality and gender difference to secure political legitimacy. As a result, American readers will not only gain a better understanding of Putin's posturing and Pussy Riot's protests, but also see our own discourses of power and credibility in a new light." <br>--Myra Marx Ferree, University of Wisconsin-Madison <br><p></p><br>"I recommend this provocative, innovative feminist analysis of politics in Putin's Russiato all Russia observers, students of scholars of women's and gender studies, and anyone trying to make sense of the Russia/Ukraine crisis. Sperling's insight into the foreign policy implications of misogyny, combined with her interviews with current Russian feminists, makes <em>Sex, Politics, and Putin</em> a must-read." <br>--Cynthia Enloe, author of <em>Seriously! Investigating Crashes and Crises as If Women Mattered</em> <br><p></p><br>"...this important book highlights how gender and power are inextricably linked." <br> --L.J. Roselle, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Sex, Politics &amp; Putin is the most comprehensive illustration of the regime's gender-based legitimation strategy to date, and is a must-read for those who strive to understand Putin's Russia." <br>--Gulnaz Sharafutdinova, <em>Perspectives on Politics</em><p></p><br>"Valerie Sperling's well-researched and well-documented study provides an important and different lens through which to view and analyze the current neo-cold war conflict between Russia and the West. It is a significant addition to the literature about the current Russian leader, his policies, and the future of his country." <br>--Rochelle Ruthchild, <em>Women's Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Sex, Politics, and Putin presents a goldmine of examples of how discourses on gender and sexuality are an integral part of contemporary Russian politics. This book is a must read for scholars of Russian politics and an engaging and accessible read for anyone interested in why bare-chested photos of Putin have become so popular." <br> --Mobilization, Courtney Doucette, Rutgers University<p></p><br>"lSex, Politics, and Putin is a must-read for scholars studying the politics of gender in Slavic studies...Its rich engagement with interdisciplinary studies, anthropology, and cultural studies also makes a substantial contribution to political science.

R. D. Fairbairn (1889-1964) challenged the dominance of Freud's drive theory with a psychoanalytic theory based on the internalization of human relationships. Fairbairn assumed that the unconscious develops in childhood and contains dissociated memories of parental neglect, insensitivity, and outright abuse that are impossible the children to tolerate consciously. In Fairbairn's model, these dissociated memories protect developing children from recognizing how badly they are being treated and allow them to remain attached even to physically abusive parents. <br><br>Attachment is paramount in Fairbairn's model, as he recognized that children are absolutely and unconditionally dependent on their parents. Kidnapped children who remain attached to their abusive captors despite opportunities to escape illustrate this intense dependency, even into adolescence. At the heart of Fairbairn's model is a structural theory that organizes actual relational events into three self-and-object pairs: one conscious pair (the central ego, which relates exclusively to the ideal object in the external world) and two mostly unconscious pairs (the child's antilibidinal ego, which relates exclusively to the rejecting parts of the object, and the child's libidinal ego, which relates exclusively to the exciting parts of the object). The two dissociated self-and-object pairs remain in the unconscious but can emerge and suddenly take over the individual's central ego. When they emerge, the "other" is misperceived as either an exciting or a rejecting object, thus turning these internal structures into a source of transferences and reenactments. Fairbairn's central defense mechanism, splitting, is the fast shift from central ego dominance to either the libidinal ego or the antilibidinal ego-a near perfect model of the borderline personality disorder.<br><br>In this book, David Celani reviews Fairbairn's five foundational papers and outlines their application in the clinical setting. He discusses the four unconscious structures and offers the clinician concrete suggestions on how to recognize and respond to them effectively in the heat of the clinical interview. Incorporating decades of experience into his analysis, Celani emphasizes the internalization of the therapist as a new "good" object and devotes entire sections to the treatment of histrionic, obsessive, and borderline personality disorders.</p><p>David P. Celani is a licensed psychologist who practiced for more than twenty-five years in Burlington, Vermont. In treatment, he focused on his patients' "attachment to bad objects," which was manifested by their inability to separate from parents, friends, or marital partners who demeaned, criticized, or abused them. Celani now presents workshops throughout the United States on object relations theory. His books with Columbia University Press include <i>The Illusion of Love: Why the Battered Woman Returns to Her Abuser</i> and <i>Leaving Home: The Art of Separating from Your Difficult Family</i>.<p>Copyright information</p> <p>Excerpt from <strong>Chapter 3: The Dynamic Relationships Between the Pathological Ego Structures </strong></p> <p>This chapter focuses on Fairbairn's four pathological self and object structures, with an emphasis on understanding patient productions during the clinical interview. When working with patients suffering from severe splits in their ego structures, it is critical to know which subego or internalized object is dominant. The discussion begins with a description of each ego structure and then the relationship of each to its object partner. This is followed by an examination of the four fundamental relational patterns of transference that can emerge between patient and therapist, along with techniques that can be used to soften the patient's rigid adherence to her inner structures. The chapter continues with a lengthy discussion of the reemergence of dissociated material from the antilibidinal ego, and with therapeutic strategies that foster its integration into the central ego. Finally, the negative therapeutic reaction is examined in terms of Fairbairn's inner structures.</p> <p>The four internal ego structures are not composed of hundreds of separate actual interpersonal events that are sequentially dissociated and held in the unconscious. Rather, they are complex views of the object over time that are melded together and modified by the child's fantasies and fears that were appropriate to the age at which the dissociation took place:</p> <p>"It is important however to keep in mind that these constellations do not represent a simple internalization of an actual experience with an external person. They are multilayered representations built up at different levels of development over the years as the growing person takes in the experience of relationships as modified by his own fantasies and by the limited ability to understand that which was present during the particular stage of development at the time of each experience."</p> <p>Thus each of the four structures is complex; each is a limited sub-personality with a distinct view of the world as well as the ability to plan and make decisions, and each can become the dominant ego directing the patient's life.</p> <p> <strong>The Antilibidinal Ego </strong></p> <p>Although my effort here is to focus on the antilibidinal ego, it is impossible to speak of one structure without referring to the others, as seen in chapter 2. It may seem difficult at first for the clinician to differentiate the antilibidinal ego from the rejecting object. However, they are vastly different and play distinct roles in the interior world, as well as in the transference relationship. The fundamental difference between these two structures is that the rejecting object attacks, demeans, and humiliates the antilibidinal ego from a position of power, and its rejection can be absolute. The antilibidinal ego is the self of the developing child that relates exclusively to the rejecting object, and its response to these attacks are self-hate, shame, and sarcasm toward those in power, which often manifests later in life as a self-righteous condemnation of those who have failed in their assigned role (as parent, leader, or authority). In some cases, this amounts to "whining" and chronic complaining about the failures of their objects, whereas in other patients it can take the form of an interpersonal revenge-based "crusade" against the specific objects or a displaced group of objects, one that takes on the emotionality of a religious war. I turn now to an example from Fairbairn's 1954 paper on hysteria, cited previously (Celani 2001), that clearly demonstrates that Fairbairn saw patients with exactly the same type of relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object as we see in our patients today. The exceptional aspect about this passage is that the patient is actually thought to be the analyst Harry Guntrip, whom, as noted, Fairbairn treated in analysis:</p> <p>"In his inner world he was constantly engaged in an argument with his mother over his right to possess a penis and to use it as he wished -- a right which, in the light of his mother's reactions (to which reference has already been made), he felt that she denied to him. This imagined argument with his mother assumed the essential form of an attempt on his part to convert her to a "belief in penises," in place of the hatred of penises which he attributed to her (not without reason). More specifically, he sought to persuade her to accept his own penis, and to give him permission to use it: for, in his bondage to her, he felt that he did not dare to use his penis without her permission -- except in secret masturbation, about which he felt extremely guilty. (Fairbairn 1954:34)"</p> <p>This is a classic example of a relationship characterized by "whining" and complaining between the child's antilibidinal ego and the rejecting aspect of the maternal object. Here the antilibidinal ego is engaged in a lobbying effort to reform the position taken by the all-powerful and implacable rejecting object. Once the relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object is internalized, neither structure is able to assimilate information from the external world that might modify its position. I have noted earlier that Fairbairn <i>did not see</i> the hostile and antagonistic relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object. He mistook the relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object as a cooperative one, in which the antilibidinal ego does the bidding of the rejecting object, yet this example from his own work illustrates just the opposite. Here the patient's antilibidinal ego is pleading and lobbying for permission and understanding of his legitimate needs from his insensitive parental object. The flaws in Fairbairn's original understanding of the dynamics between the internal structures blinded him to the therapeutic possibilities of working to counteract the self-defeating and rigid relationship between these structures.</p> <p>Odgen (1990) has also written of the antagonism between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object. He noted that the struggle between theses structures is never won, as they fight each other to an eternal "draw":</p> <p>"The suborganization identified with the object is under constant pressure from the self component of the relationship to be transformed into a good object. Such a transformation is strenuously resisted by the object component, because this type of massive shift in identity would be experienced as an annihilation of an aspect of the ego. The internal object relationship is vigorously defended from two directions: The self-component is unwilling to risk annihilation resulting from absence of object relatedness and instead strives to change the bad object into a good one; at the same time, the object component fends off annihilation that would result from being transformed into a new entity (the good object)"</p> <p>Ironically, Odgen is a Kleinian and Winicottian, and yet he is one of the few writers in the field who has described the struggle between these antagonistic components in Fairbairn's structural model. The powerful, yet often pathetic and neglectful, parental object, who has been internalized as the rejecting object, maintains its enormous status in the inner world because the child's infantile antilibidinal ego needs the rejecting object to become a good object and act as the catalyst for its development. This is a task in which the rejecting object steadfastly refuses to participate. The child's antilibidinal ego's total dependence on the rejecting object keeps it forever responding to this antagonistic inner structure, which never loses its potency. In some patients, the antilibidinal ego gives up trying to reform the bad object and switches to a strategy of exposing the bad object parent to the public. Like the snake and the mongoose, these two structures simply cannot leave each other alone.</p> <p>One of the most striking characteristics of the antilibidinal ego is its self-righteous desire for revenge and its demand for reparation for the hurts it has suffered. I am not exaggerating when I say that some borderline individuals have spent most of their lives demanding, in various impotent and self-defeating ways, that their original parental objects are somehow "charged" with violations of the parent--child contract. Ogden (1990), who colorfully describes the antilibidinal ego as the "wronged and spoiling self," emphasizes the actions of the antilibidinal ego in the inner world; however, when this subego becomes the dominant ego, it often attempts to expose the parental object's badness in the external world as well: "The second category of bond to a bad internal object is the tie of the wronged and spoiling self to the unloving, rejecting object. This often takes the form of a crusade to expose the unfairness of, coldness of, or other forms of wrongdoing on the part of the internal object" (156).</p> <p>The antilibidinal ego has a sense of purpose and direction, and consequently its antagonistic relationship to the internalized rejecting object is easily projected onto objects in external reality. As we will see, the intensity of the relationship between the part-self and part-object structure causes the antilibidinal ego to feel that it is engaged in a self-righteous mission, which forecloses the intrusion of external objects into this meaningful and intensely emotional internal world. Kopp (1978), an existential psychologist whom I have previously quoted (Celani 2005), illustrates this aspect of the antilibidinal ego:</p> <p>"Imagining themselves to be the heroes or heroines of as yet uncompleted fairy tales, such people simply cannot (will not) believe that the villains who have disappointed them will go unpunished, or that they themselves will remain blameless yet uncompensated victims. Surely there must be someone who will avenge them, and take good care of them, someone who will right the family wrongs and reward the good children."</p> <p>Perfectly captured here is the tone of one of the most com...</p></p><h2>A Study of Spinoza&#39;s Ethics</h2><p>"With an astonishing erudition . . . and in a direct no-nonsense style, Bennett expounds, compares, and criticizes Spinoza&#x2019;s theses. . . .

He felt flavor also as a physical shape in his hands, and the chicken had come out "too round." This offbeat comment in 1980 launched Cytowic's exploration into the oddity called synesthesia. He is one of the few world authorities on the subject. Sharing a root with anesthesia ("no sensation"), synesthesia means "joined sensation," whereby a voice, for example, is not only heard but also seen, felt, or tasted. The trait is involuntary, hereditary, and fairly common. It stayed a scientific mystery for two centuries until Cytowic's original experiments led to a neurological explanation&#x2015;and to a new concept of brain organization that accentuates emotion over reason. That chicken dinner two decades ago led Cytowic to explore a deeper reality that, he argues, exists in everyone but is often just below the surface of awareness (which is why finding meaning in our lives can be elusive). In this medical detective adventure, Cytowic shows how synesthesia, far from being a mere curiosity, illuminates a wide swath of mental life and leads to a new view of what is means to be human&#x2015;a view that turns upside down conventional ideas about reason, emotional knowledge, and self-understanding. This 2003 edition features a new afterword.</p></p><p><i>The Man Who Tasted Shapes</i> brings us the solution to a bizarre medical mystery, and leads us to a new understanding of the human mind that turns our conventional notions about reason and emotion inside out.I wrote the first English textbook on this fascinating merging of the senses in 1989.

The author actually uses the term Professional ECE teacher throughout the chapters. Applying theory to Practical, easy to implement ideas is thoroughly developed throughout the chapters. The policy boxes at the end of the chapters help students understand putting theory and research into practice and this is easily found in the chapters. There is discussion on developmentally appropriate practices throughout the chapters, as well. The theme not mentioned above, Families and Cultural Diversity is also seen within each chapter. The authors definitely placed an emphasis on diversity and I see it throughout.&#x201d; Author: Kimberly K.

This textbook covers all of these age groups throughout the chapters. There are vignettes that focus on different ages. The sample lesson plans have examples for each age group... In my experience, many ECE textbooks focus on birth to age 5, but tend to leave out or not place as much emphasis on the early elementary students.

It is the first in-depth study of the pre-Enlightenment methods by which Europeans attempted to describe and classify the American Indian and his society. Between 1512 and 1724 a simple determinist view of human society was replaced by a more sophisticated relativist approach. Anthony Pagden uses new methods of technical analysis, already developed in philosophy and anthropology, to examine four groups of writers who analysed Indian culture: the sixteenth-century theologian, Francisco de Vitoria, and his followers; the &#39;champion of the Indians&#39; Bartolom� de Las Casas; and the Jesuit historians Jos� de Acosta and Joseph Fran�ois Lafitau. Dr Pagden explains the sources for their theories and how these conditioned their observations. He also examines for the first time the key terms in each writer&#39;s vocabulary - words such as &#39;barbarian&#39; and &#39;civil&#39; - and the assumptions that lay beneath them.</p><p>A history of the changing intellectual attitudes in 16th- and 17th-century Spain towards the American Indians and their society.'Pagden's subtle account ... is a model for the history of anthropology altogether. It shows, too, how constant some of the subject's central conceptions have been over the succeeding four hundred years.' The London Review of Books<br><br>' ... in the subtlety of its analysis and the richness of its detail The Fall of Natural Man surpasses all previous writings on the subject in any language.' The Times Higher Education Supplement<br><br>'The strength and novelty of the book consists in the seriousness with which Pagden reconstructs the classificatory theories of sixteenth-century Iberians and uses them to explain much of their writing on the Indians.' Political Studies<br><br>'We must thank Anthony Pagden for having, in this erudite and well-written study, demonstrated in a definitive manner the importance of the ethnological contribution of sixteenth-century Spanish authors.'

That's why every web developer should know how to use JavaScript. The problem is that JavaScript is surprisingly difficult to learn, not only for programming novices but also for experienced programmers. But now, Murach's JavaScript (2nd Edition) makes it easier than ever to become an accomplished JavaScript programmer.</p><p>To make that possible, section 1 of this book presents a six-chapter course in JavaScript that gets you off to a great start. This section works for programming novices as well as experienced programmers because it lets you set your own pace. When you finish this section, you'll be able to write, test, and debug JavaScript applications of your own.</p><p>Then, section 2 builds on that base by presenting the additional skills that every JavaScript programmer must have. That includes working with arrays and web storage, creating and using your own object types in object-oriented applications, using regular expressions for data validation, and much more. For many developers, sections 1 and 2 will be all that they need to know.</p><p>But for those who want to move on to the expert level, section 3 presents the skills that will get you there. That includes skills like how to bulletproof your applications by using closures, namespaces, and modules; how to make your functions more useful by using callbacks; and how to use JSON to transmit and store data. Then, the last chapter in this section introduces you to jQuery and shows you how it can make your JavaScript code even better.</p></p><p><p>Mary Delamater has been building applications for clients since 2006.

In this distinctive collection, editors Charles A. Hill and Marguerite Helmers examine the connection between visual images and persuasion, or how images act rhetorically upon viewers. Chapters included here highlight the differences and commonalities among a variety of projects identified as "visual rhetoric," leading to a more precise definition of the term and its role in rhetorical studies. <br><br>Contributions to this volume consider a wide variety of sites of image production--from architecture to paintings, from film to needlepoint--in order to understand how images and texts work upon readers as symbolic forms of representation. Each chapter discusses, analyzes, and explains the visual aspect of a particular subject, and illustrates the ways in which messages and meaning are communicated visually. The contributions include work from rhetoric scholars in the English and communication disciplines, and represent a variety of methodologies--theoretical, textual analysis, psychological research, and cultural studies, among others. The editors seek to demonstrate that every new turn in the study of rhetorical practices reveals more possibilities for discussion, and that the recent "turn to the visual" has revealed an inexhaustible supply of new questions, problems, and objects for investigation. As a whole, the chapters presented here demonstrate the wide range of scholarship that is possible when a field begins to take seriously the analysis of images as important cultural and rhetorical forces. <br><br><i>Defining Visual Rhetorics</i> is appropriate for graduate or advanced undergraduate courses in rhetoric, English, mass communication, cultural studies, technical communication, and visual studies.

It&#39;s clear descriptions of timeless fundamental principles make Chow a classic. Anyone wanting to learn, to teach, and to work with water and fluids must own a copy. Open-Channel Hydraulics deals with the design for flow in open channels and their related structures. Covering both theory and practice, it attempts to bridge the gap that generally exists between the two. Theory is introduced first and is then applied to design problems. In many cases the application of theory is illustrated with practical examples. Theory is frequently simplified by adopting theoretically less rigorous treatments with sound concepts, by avoiding use of advanced mathematical manipulations, or by replacing such manipulations with practical numerical procedures. To facilitate understanding of the subject matter, the treatment is mostly based on the condition of one- or two-dimensional flow. The book deals mainly with American practice but also includes related information from many countries throughout the world. Material is divided into five main sections for an orderly and logical treatment of the subject: Basic Principles. Uniform Flow, Varied Flow, Rapidly Varied Flow, and Unsteady Flow. There are 67 illustrative examples, 282 illustrations, 319 problems, and 810 references. This classic textbook was the first English-language book on the subject in two decades. Open-Channel Hydraulics is a valuable text for students of engineering mechanics. hydraulics. civil. agricultural. sanitary. and mechanical engineering, and a helpful compendium for practicing engineers.</p><p>Dr. Ven Te Chow was a Professor of Hydraulic Engineering and led the hydraulic engineering research and teaching programs at the University of Illinois. Through many years of experience as a teacher, engineer, researcher, writer. lecturer, and consultant, he became an internationally recognized leader in the fields of hydraulics, hydrology and hydraulic engineering. Dr. Ven Te Chow authored two technical books and more than 60 articles and papers in scientific an engineering magazines and journals.

Against the prevalent notion that there was an ethical or religious "turn" in Derrida's thinking, H�gglund argues that a radical atheism informs Derrida's work from beginning to end. Proceeding from Derrida's insight into the constitution of time, H�gglund demonstrates how Derrida rethinks the condition of identity, ethics, religion, and political emancipation in accordance with the logic of radical atheism. H�gglund challenges other major interpreters of Derrida's work and offers a compelling account of Derrida's thinking on life and death, good and evil, self and other. Furthermore, H�gglund does not only explicate Derrida's position but also develops his arguments, fortifies his logic, and pursues its implications. The result is a groundbreaking deconstruction of the perennial philosophical themes of time and desire as well as pressing contemporary issues of sovereignty and democracy.</p><p>Martin H�gglund is a Charlotte W. Newcombe Fellow in Comparative Literature at Cornell University. He is the author of <i>Chronophobia: Essays on Time and Finitude</i>, which was published in Swedish in 2002. In Spring 2009, <i>CR: The New Centennial Review</i> will publish a special issue devoted to his work. Visit Martin Hagglund's website: www.martinhagglund.se"A commanding and refreshing interpretation of Derrida which promises to be a crucial intervention in critical disagreements over Derrida's legacy.<i>Radical Atheism</i> is an important and prescient volume.It re-assesses Derrida's work and its philosophical futures with care, vision, and scholarly rigour, serving to regenerate interest in Derrida for a generation of philosophers for whom his name has fallen out of fashion." (Danielle Sands <i><i>Parrhesia</i></i>)<br><br>"Martin H�gglund's <i>Radical Atheism</i> is a tour de force . . . It lives up to [its] bold claim, offering a remarkable tour of Jacques Derrida's diverse and demanding oeuvre via lucid arguments and clear prose. H�gglund demonstrates an impressive command of Derrida's corpus, marshaling these materials skillfully and effectively in rigorous, firmly grounded textual analyses . . . [It is] certainly worthy of the attention it continues to receive, both for its own merits and because any discussion of Derrida and religion will now have to attend to and contend with H�gglund's powerful text." (William Robert <i><i>Sophia</i></i>)<br><br>"With exceptional care and insight, H�gglund construes the vital implications and enduring positions of Derrida's work." (Avital Ronell <i>New York University</i>)<br><br>"Martin H�gglund has produced an exceptional work. It is peerless and groundbreaking in its originality and contributes the most consistent, compelling and complete articulation of Derrida's work. In summation <i>Radical Atheism</i> is daring and persuasive in opening up materialist and atheistic vistas for future deconstructive analysis. Derrida is portrayed as a philosopher concerned with the thick of life in its vicissitudes. It offers a forceful account of how Derrida meditates on questions of life and death, good and evil, politics and the meaning of mortality. It will prove attractive to all readers of Derrida, professional and student alike and undoubtedly will become a definitive starting point for understanding deconstruction." (Patrick O'Connor <i><i>Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>Radical Atheism</i> is the most accurate, insightful, and complete account anyone has produced so far of Derrida's thought. H�gglund refutes a whole panoply of influential misreadings of Derrida, and he does so with a flair and clarity rarely attained by writers on deconstruction." (Henry Staten <i><i>The New Centennial Review</i></i>)<br><br>"Like the best of philosophers measured by Nietzschean standards, H�gglund could be characterized as marvelously 'untimely'. [A] superlative conceptual-theoretical analysis." (Adrian Johnston <i><i>The New Centennial Review</i></i>)<br><br>"In the very insightful and intelligent book by Martin H�gglund. his analysis reaches what we could call the <i>zero degree</i> of deconstruction, the point at which deconstructive logics show their internal potential and cannot be assimilated to any of the various discourses&#x2015;ethicist, religious, and so forth&#x2015;which have tried to hegemonize it." (Ernesto Laclau <i><i>Diacritics</i></i>)<br><br>"What distinguishes H�gglund's book is the philosophical acumen with which he delineates its consequences and the rigour with which he deploys them against the <i>faux amis</i> of deconstruction. Whether or not one finds the philosophy that H�gglund expounds compelling, the rare virtue of his book is that it forces us to assess that philosophy <i>correctly</i>." (Nathan Brown <i><i>Radical Philosophy</i></i>)<br><br>"In his important and hard-hitting new book, Martin H�gglund lucidly delineates the argument by means of which Derrida problematises the desire for plenitude in its various guises, and on the strength of this clarity of insight offers trenchant critiques of a number of interpretations of Derridean thought that simplify or distort it. H�gglund goes on to show in a sharper light even than Derrida elected to do how [time] provides the basis for the latter's treatment of the most far-reaching topics, starting with life itself. H�gglund has shown superbly how Derrida's account of time underlies his explorations of these ethical topics, and how unlike traditional ethical postures the results are." (Derek Attridge <i><i>Derrida Today</i></i>)<br><br>"In this explosive little book on Derrida.H�gglund extracts and explicates what he claims is the core idea of Derrida's work, writing without the piousness, esoterism, or obliqueness that has critically imprisoned his subject. H�gglund's refutation of the idea of an ethical turn in deconstruction is definitive and his association of Derrida's thought with radical atheism is compelling."

Major waterways through these lands and the defensible terrain of the Ozark range provided the tribe a distinct advantage in prehistoric and early historic times. A warlike people, the Osage long encroached on neighboring tribal lands, especially those of the Caddo to the southwest. Yet good natural boundaries and centuries of success in warfare afforded the tribe little advantage in attempts to forestall Euro-American westward expansion. Three major routes to the West&#x2014;the Missouri and Arkansas Rivers and the Continental Trail&#x2014;crossed Osage land, so conflict with the newcomers was inevitable.<br></p><p>Louis Burns draws on ancestral oral traditions and research in a broad body of literature to tell the story of the Osage people.

Beginning with an analytic approach, the author reviews the functions of Schlafli and Lobatschefsky and discusses number theory in a dissertation on integral Cayley numbers. A detailed examination of group theory includes discussion of Wythoff's construction for uniform polytopes, as well as a chapter on regular skew polyhedra in three and four dimensions and their topological analogues. A profile of self-dual configurations and regular graphs introduces elements of graph theory, followed up with a chapter on twelve points in PG (5, 3) with 95040 self-transformations. Discussion of an upper bound for the number of equal nonoverlapping spheres that can touch another same-sized sphere develops aspects of communication theory, while relativity theory is explored in a chapter on reflected light signals.<br>Additional topics include the classification of zonohedra by means of projective diagrams, arrangements of equal spheres in non-Euclidean spaces, and regular honeycombs in hyperbolic space.

Grounded in an in-depth review of the clinical and research literature, and drawing on the author&#x2019;s 40-plus years of experience, it describes the three main approaches to conceptualizing couple distress and treatment&#x2015;systemic, psychodynamic, and behavioral&#x2015;and shows how they can be integrated into a model that draws on the best of each. Unlike multi-authored texts in which each chapter presents a distinct brand of couple therapy, this book simultaneously engages multiple viewpoints and synthesizes them into a coherent model.

The Art of Problem Solving Russ Ackoff--author, consultant, and teacher extraordinaire. During his long career, he has shown thousands of managers, architects, engineers, attorneys, advertising people, software developers, and scientists the way to more creative, artful problem solving. This new paper edition of The Art of Problem Solving is perhaps the best example of Ackoff in action. Step by step, this practical guide shows you how to develop an understanding of the art of creative thinking and the design of creative solutions. Using &#34;Ackoff&#39;s Fables&#34;--humorous yet eminently practical parables, based on real problems by real managers--you&#39;ll see why solving a problem seldom solves the problem, but why approaching it from a new, unorthodox angle often does. The result is vintage Ackoff--controversial, funny, and always on target. If you like to dig beyond simple solutions--to imaginative solutions that work--this book is for you.</p><p>Uses a unique perspective to overcome the deficiencies of a purely scientific approach to managerial decision making. Explores the creative art of problem solving, presenting material in a discursive style. Focus is on discussing a serious activity with some humor (with accompanying ``fables&#39;&#39;--based on real problems faced by real managers--for illustration). Examines principal obstructions to creative problem solving and provides methods for their correction.

It therefore must govern by principles of justice that do not presuppose any particular vision of the good life. But can any such principles be found?

The Roman Catholic Church recognizes saints through canonization based on evidence that they worked miracles, as signs of their proximity to God. Physicianhistorian Jacalyn Duffin has examined Vatican sources on 1400 miracles from six continents and spanning four centuries. Overwhelmingly the miracles cited in canonizations between 1588 and 1999 are healings, and the majority entail medical care and physician testimony.<br> <br> These remarkable records contain intimate stories of illness, prayer, and treatment, as told by people who rarely leave traces: peasants and illiterates, men and women, old and young. A woman's breast tumor melts away; a man's wounds knit; a lame girl suddenly walks; a dead baby revives. Suspicious of wishful thinking or na�ve enthusiasm, skeptical clergy shaped the inquiries to identify recoveries that remain unexplained by the best doctors of the era. The tales of healing are supplemented with substantial testimony from these physicians.<br> <br> Some elements of the miracles change through time. Duffin shows that doctors increase in number; new technologies are embraced quickly; diagnoses shift with altered capabilities. But other aspects of the miracles are stable. The narratives follow a dramatic structure, shaped by the formal questions asked of each witness and by perennial reactions to illness and healing. In this history, medicine and religion emerge as parallel endeavors aimed at deriving meaningful signs from particular instances of human distress -- signs to explain, alleviate, and console in confrontation with suffering and mortality.<br> <br> A lively, sweeping analysis of a fascinating set of records, this book also poses an exciting methodological challenge to historians: miracle stories are a vital source not only on the thoughts and feelings of ordinary people, but also on medical science and its practitioners.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jacalyn Duffin</strong>, physician and historian, holds the Hannah Chair for the History of Medicine, Queen's University, Ontario.<br><br>"For individual sufferers, healing and survival can be both spiritual and physical experiences. Dr. Duffin -- medical practitioner and historian -- boldly delves into a seldom-analyzed relationship between religion and medicine. Medically attested miracles are an unusual topic for research, often featured to praise or ridicule phenomena lacking scientific explanation. The author's meticulous and balanced analysis of past investigations into the miraculous coupled with her keen clinical eye will be widely read and discussed by skeptics and believers alike." --<strong>Guenter B. Risse</strong>, M.D., Ph.D., Professor Emeritus, University of California, San Francisco <br><p></p><br>"This book is an important new study of the relationship between religion and medicine. Penned by a well-established medical scientist and modern historian, it places this relationship at the forefront of research on miracles...it opens up a realm of opportunities to historians, for whom it will no doubt become a seminal work. Medievalists, too, will now have to reconsider their own work in the light of Duffin's findings."--<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> <br><p></p><br>"A thoroughly engaging, daring exploration of depositions from canonization proceedings in the Vatican Archives that reveals the centrality of medical judgment and physicians' testimony in the adjudication of miracles during the past four hundred years. Rich in stories about the place and meanings of miracles in everyday life, in Duffin's hands these records offer astonishingly fresh insight into the interplay between religion and medicine and into the wider cultural power of medicine in the modern world." --<strong>John Harley Warner</strong>, Avalon Professor of the History of Medicine, Yale University <br><p></p><br>"Drawing upon Vatican canonization records, Jacalyn Duffin's study of healing miracles examines the sometimes competitive, sometimes complementary relationships between pre-modern and modern medicine and the cult of the saints. Her thorough reading of some 1,400 miracle accounts unearths patterns of spiritual healing that have been a vital part of Europeans' lives and her keen eye for detail provides welcome insights into the long-neglected story of faith and its healing potential." --<strong>Philip Soergel</strong>, Department of History, University of Maryland <br><p></p><br>"Duffin's account of the medical history of the canonization process is in many respects revelatory....Duffin's interrogation of the records is thoughtful and multilayered; the reflections in her concluding section are of special interest, because they relate to the relationship between religion, medicine, and the miracles of healing."--<em>JAMA</em> <br><p></p><br>"Written by a medical historian, this research is of great interest."--<em>Pediatric Endocrinology Reviews</em> <br><p></p><br>"This is pioneering research with great theoretical and practical interest; it should engage anyone curous about the unknown limits of human capacity."--<em>Journal of Scientific Exploration</em> <br><p></p><br>"Although not the first scholar to broach the subject of miracles through the lens of medical science, Duffin brings a refreshingly new perspective and style... Overall, this is a thoughtful and thought-provoking book that should prove valuable to a range of readers, including historians and sociologists of medicine and religion, as well as believers and skeptics of the miraculous." --<em>Journal of the History of Medicine</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Caesar&#39;s Commentaries.

How, then, does Orthodoxy respond to the political realization of a Jewish homeland that is the State of Israel? In this cogent and searching study, Aviezer Ravitzky probes Orthodoxy's divergent positions on Zionism, which range from radical condemnation to virtual beatification.<br> <br> Ravitzky traces the roots of Haredi ideology, which opposes the Zionist enterprise, and shows how Haredim living in Israel have come to terms with a state to them unholy and therefore doomed. Ravitzky also examines radical religious movements, including the Gush Emunim, to whom the State of Israel is a divine agent. He concludes with a discussion of the recent transformation of Habad Hassidism from conservatism to radical messianism.<br> <br> This book is indispensable to anyone concerned with the complex confrontation between Jewish fundamentalism and Israeli political sovereignty, especially in light of the tragic death of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.<br></p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Hebrew</p><h2>Corruption: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Corruption is one of the biggest global issues, ahead of extreme poverty, unemployment, the rising cost of food and energy, climate change, and terrorism.

It remained for Dr. Jammer, noted scholar and historian of science, to trace the evolution of the idea of space in this comprehensive, thought-provoking study. The focus of the book is on physical, rather than metaphysical, ideas of space; however, philosophical or theological speculations are discussed when relevant. The author has also given special attention to the cultural settings in which the theories developed. <br>Following a Foreword by Albert Einstein and an introductory chapter on the concept of space in antiquity, subsequent chapters consider Judaeo-Christian ideas about space, the emancipation of the space concept from Aristotelianism, Newton's concept of absolute space and the concept of space from the eighteenth century to the present. For this third edition, Dr. Jammer has contributed an extensive new chapter six, reviewing the numerous and profound changes in the philosophy of space since the publication of the second edition. <br>An abundance of meticulously documented quotations from original sources and numerous bibliographic references make this an exceptionally well-documented book. It is essential reading for philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians, but even nonprofessional readers will find it accessible.</p><p>Physicist Max Jammer (1915&#x2013;2010) was a close colleague of Albert Einstein and a lecturer at Princeton University. He also taught at Harvard University, the University of Oklahoma, and Boston University before establishing the Physics Department at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, where he also served as Professor, President, and Rector.</p><h2>Capitalism at the Crossroads: Next Generation Business Strategies for a Post-Crisis World</h2><p><p>Today&#x2019;s era of economic crisis has sent a powerful message: The age of "mercenary" capitalism is ending. We must finally embark on a new age of sustainable, stakeholder-based capitalism. While enlightened executives and policymakers understand the critical need for change, few have tangible plans for making it happen. In <i>Capitalism at the Crossroads: Next Generation Business Strategies for a Post-Crisis World, Third Edition</i>, Stuart L. Hart presents new strategies for identifying sustainable products, technologies, and business models that will drive urgently needed growth and help solve social and environmental problems at the same time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing on his experience consulting with top companies and NGOs worldwide, Hart shows how to craft your optimal sustainability strategy and overcome the limitations of traditional "greening" approaches.

We must finally embark on a new age of sustainable, stakeholder-based capitalism. While enlightened executives and policymakers understand the critical need for change, few have tangible plans for making it happen. In &#34;Capitalism at the Crossroads&#34;, Stuart L. Hart presents new strategies for identifying sustainable products, technologies, and business models that will drive urgently needed growth and help solve social and environmental problems at the same time. Drawing on his experience consulting with top companies and NGOs worldwide, Hart shows how to craft your optimal sustainability strategy and overcome the limitations of traditional &#34;greening&#34; approaches.

It includes authoritative coverage of all the major areas related to behavioral neurology, neuropsychology, and neuropsychiatry. Each chapter, written by a world-renowned expert in the relevant area, provides an introductory background as well as an up-to-date review of the most recent developments. Clinical relevance is emphasized but is placed in the context of cognitive neuroscience, basic neuroscience, and functional imaging. Major cognitive domains such as frontal lobe function, attention and neglect, memory, language, prosody, complex visual processing, and object identification are reviewed in detail. A comprehensive chapter on behavioral neuroanatomy provides a background for brain-behavior interactions in the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebullum. Chapters on temperolimbic epilepsy, major psychiatric syndromes, and dementia provide in-depth analyses of these neurobehavioral entities and their neurobiological coordinates. Changes for this second edition include the reflection throughout the book of the new and flourishing alliance of behavioral neurology, neuropsychology, and neuropsychiatry with cognitive science;major revision of all chapters; new authorship of those on language and memory; and the inclusion of entirely new chapters on psychiatric syndromes and the dementias.

The book offers a vibrant picture of a world full of plungers, powerful bankers, corporate titans, millionaire brokers, and buoyantly optimistic stock market bulls. We meet Sunshine Charley Mitchell, head of the National City Bank, powerful financiers Jack Morgan and Jacob Schiff, Wall Street manipulators such as the legendary Jesse Livermore, and the lavish-living Billy Durant, founder of General Motors. As Klein follows the careers of these men, he shows us how the financial house of cards gradually grew taller, as the irrational exuberance of an earlier age gripped America and convinced us that the market would continue to rise forever. Then, in October 1929, came a "perfect storm"-like convergence of factors that shook Wall Street to its foundations. We relive Black Thursday, when police lined Wall Street, brokers grew hysterical, customers "bellowed like lunatics," and the ticker tape fell hours behind.<br><br>This compelling history of the Crash--the first to follow the market closely for the two years leading up to the disaster--illuminates a major turning point in our history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Maury Klein</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Rhode Island and one of the most acclaimed historians of American business at work today.

The question has always been how. <em>In A Sense of the Enemy</em>, the historian Zachary Shore demonstrates that leaders can best understand an opponent not simply from his pattern of past behavior, but from his behavior at pattern breaks. Meaningful pattern breaks occur during dramatic deviations from the routine, when the enemy imposes costs upon himself. It's at these unexpected moments, Shore explains, that successful leaders can learn what makes their rivals truly tick.<br><br>Shore presents a uniquely revealing history of twentieth-century conflict. With vivid, suspenseful prose, he takes us into the minds of statesmen, to see how they in turn tried to enter the minds of others. In the process, he shows how this type of mind-reading, which he calls "strategic empathy," shaped matters of war and peace. Mahatma Gandhi, for instance, was an excellent strategic empath. In the wake of a British massacre of unarmed Indian civilians, how did Gandhi know that nonviolence could ever be effective? And what of Gustav Stresemann, the 21-year-old Wunderkind Ph.D., who rose from lobbyist for chocolate makers to Chancellor of Germany. How did he manage to resurrect his nation to great power status after its humiliating loss in World War One? And then there is Le Duan, the shadowy Marxist manipulator who was actually running North Vietnam during the 1960s, as opposed to Ho Chi Minh. How did this rigid ideologue so skillfully discern America's underlying constraints? And, armed with this awareness, how did he construct a grand strategy to defeat the United States? One key to all these leaders' triumphs came from the enemy's behavior at pattern breaks.<br><br>Drawing on research from the cognitive sciences, and tapping multilingual, multinational sources, Shore has crafted an innovative history of the last century's most pivotal moments, when lives and nations were on the line. Through this curious study of strategic empathy, we gain surprising insights into how great leaders think.<br></p><p><br><strong>Zachary Shore</strong> is an Associate Professor of History at the Naval Postgraduate School. He is the author of <em>What Hitler Knew</em>, <em>Breeding Bin Ladens</em>, and <em>Blunder</em>.<br><br>"Deeply researched, well argued, and often convincing....Offers an intriguing and fresh interpretation of some of recent history's best-known and most important global conflicts."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"What Zachary Shore refers to as 'strategic empathy' is a vitally important concept in international affairs, and he is to be lauded for this intelligent, discerning, and engagingly written book."--Fredrik Logevall, author of <em>Embers of War</em>, winner of the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for History<p></p><br>"Zachary Shore articulates a provocative and compelling argument about a crucial yet understudied issue lying at the heart of decision making--how to read one's rivals. The analysis is developed in the context of artfully chosen, snappily written, historical case studies that make for captivating reading in and of themselves. This work will be of significant value and interest to scholars and policy makers alike."--Aviel Roshwald, author of <em>The Endurance of Nationalism</em><p></p><br>"<em>A Sense of the Enemy</em> will reward all readers concerned with foreign-policy strategy."--<em>Michigan War Studies Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The West: A New History</h2><p><p><strong>Two outstanding historians rebuild the West at the center of the Western Civilizations course</strong></p> This beautifully written history recenters the West and rekindles the past in a vivid narrative crafted for beginning students.

This book is a combination of an introduction to basic legal principles, analysis of excerpts from instructive cases, and practical advice. It is an original approach to learning about law for those who work for the public good, the culmination of more than twenty-five years of research, study, counseling, law reform work, and reflection on what the law is and should be and how this can be explained to any reasonably thoughtful person. The book combines substantive coverage of law subjects likely to be encountered in public administration, analysis of illustrative cases, and practical advice. It distills and simplifies complex topics and combines legal theory with practical realities. The book describes the general nature of the laws, cases, and legal principles that public administrators are most likely to encounter. It begins by considering the sources of rules that govern our behavior, the evolution of formal law, and formal sources of law in the United States legal system. The next several chapters discuss constitutional law principles, providing an overview of important issues and analyzing important illustrative cases. The next several chapters follow a similar approach to the main law subjects likely to be encountered in public administration. The remaining chapters cover practical matters, including public ethics, how to deal with lawyers, and how to do legal research.</p><p>Professor of Public Law and Government , School of Government, University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill, North Carolina</p><h2>American Political Parties and Elections: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Few Americans and even fewer citizens of other nations understand the electoral process in the United States. Still fewer understand the role played by political parties in the electoral process or the ironies within the system. Participation in elections in the United States is much lower than in the vast majority of mature democracies. Perhaps this is because of the lack of competition in a country where only two parties have a true chance of winning, despite the fact that a large number of citizens claim allegiance to neither and think badly of both. Or perhaps it is because in the U.S. campaign contributions disproportionately favor incumbents in most legislative elections, or that largely unregulated groups such as the now notorious 527s have as much impact on the outcome of a campaign as do the parties or the candidates' campaign organizations. These factors offer a very clear picture of the problems that underlay our much trumpeted electoral system.<br><br>The second edition of this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> introduces the reader to these issues and more. Drawing on updated data and new examples from the 2016 presidential nominations, L. Sandy Maisel provides an insider's view of how the system actually works while shining a light on some of its flaws. He also illustrates the growing impact of campaigning through social media, the changes in campaign financing wrought by the Supreme Court recent decisions, and the Tea Party's influence on the sub-presidential nominating process. As the United States enter what is sure to be yet another highly contested election year, it is more important than ever that Americans take the time to learn the system that puts so many in power.<br></p><p><br><strong>L.

A selection of his published papers is presented here in two volumes, structured to indicate the direction and essential unity of the work. He starts from a polemical concern with behaviourism and other reductionist theories (particularly in psychology and the philosophy of language) which aim to model the study of man on the natural sciences. This leads to a general critique of naturalism, its historical development and its importance for modern culture and consciousness; and that in turn points, forward to a positive account of human agency and the self, the constitutive role of language and value, and the scope of practical reason. The volumes jointly present some two decades of work on these fundamental themes, and convey strongly the tenacity, verve and versatility of the author in grappling with them. They will interest a very wide range of philosophers and students of the human sciences.</p><p>Charles Taylor has been one of the most original and influential figures in contemporary philosophy: his &#39;philosophical anthropology&#39; spans an unusually wide range of theoretical interests and draws creatively on both Anglo-American and Continental traditions in philosophy.</p><h2>The Media and Modernity: A Social Theory of the Media</h2><p>What role have communication media played in the formation of modern societies? How should we understand the social impact of new forms of communication and information diffusion, from the advent of printing in fifteenth-century Europe to the expansion of global communication networks today? In this major new work, Thompson addresses these and other questions by elaborating a distinctive social theory of communication media and their impact. He argues that the development of communication media has transformed the spatial and temporal constitution of social life, creating new forms of action and interaction which are no longer linked to the sharing of a common locale. The consequences of this transformation are far-reaching and impinge on many aspects of our lives, from the most intimate aspects of personal experience and self-formation to the changing nature of power and visibility in the public domain. Combining breadth of vision with sensitivity to detail, this book situates the study of the media where it belongs: among a set of disciplines concerned with the emergence, development and structural characteristics of modern societies and their futures.</p><p>In this major new work Thompson addresses these and other questions by elaborating a distinctive social theory of communication media and their impact.John B.

Principles, concepts, and procedures from statics and mechanics of materials are presented at a level that can be easily understood by beginners.<p> This beginning text has been written for students of architecture, building construction, and related technologies. It is intended to provide the material for a first course in structures, treating the essential topics in statics and mechanics of materials and providing an introduction to structural analysis. The presentation is basically quantitative, and it will be most effective when used in conjunction with a book emphasizing a qualitative approach to structural behavior. </p> <p> It is assumed that the student has a background in materials and methods of construction from prior coursework or individual experience. Chapter 5 provides a very brief review of the essential characteristics of a few structural materials but is not sufficient in either depth or scope. </p> <p> A minimal background in calculus and physics has also been assumed for students of this material. Most derivations of the equations have been placed in the appendices, because they usually are not absolutely essential to the use of the equations themselves. Better students, however, will gain additional understanding and insight by consulting these derivations as they are referenced. </p> <p> As with previous editions, all sections contain examples and problems using both SI and customary units. It is hoped that instructors will be able to use either system with minimal confusion. I do not recommend using a mix of units during the first course in structures, because it might hinder the proper understanding of "first principles" that is so essential to the student's future study and practice. My school, for example, teaches the first course exclusively in SI units and the remaining ones in customary units. </p> <p> Chapter 1 has been revised and expanded to include additional material regarding why architects must be well versed in the science and art of structural behavior as well as to include some guidelines concerning structural system selection. I think teachers sometimes forget how complex this subject appears to the beginner, and how easy it is to get overwhelmed by the introduction of so many new (and, at first, seemingly unrelated) concepts. Chapter 1 should be read at the outset and then more thoroughly discussed after the study of equilibrium, bending, buckling, and other topics. </p> <p> By expressed demand, Chapters 2 and 12 hake been expanded to include additional material on graphical statics. Section 2.17 treats the graphical analysis of some relatively complicated structures and was placed in this chapter because it <i>is</i> statics, but I recommend treating this material <i>after</i> covering the graphical solution of trusses in the new Section 12.3. I usually treat trusses near the end of the first semester, because I believe that trusses are not "simple structures" and that their behavior can be understood best after bending and buckling have been discussed. This approach also has the positive feature of bringing the student back to a consideration of basic equilibrium principles after a possible period of reduced emphasis. </p> <p> I am grateful to Professors Madan Mehta, Jane Murphy, Pat Tripeny, and Falix T. Uhlik for reviewing material and providing helpful suggestions. I am especially appreciative of the continued illustrative contributions and advice of Patrick Pinnell. I also wish to thank the production editor, Christine Buckendahl; the production coordinators, C rolyn Greene and Susan Free; the graphic artist, David Tebera; and the copy editor, Wesley Morrison, for their patience and tireless efforts on my behalf. </p> <p> As stated in prior editions, please inform me of any errors you find; don't assume that I've already been notified.

It is accessible to any student of physical sciences, mathematics or engineering who has a good knowledge of calculus and of the elements of linear algebra. In addition, algebraic results are stated as needed; the less familiar ones are proved either in the text or in appendixes.<br>The topics covered in the first three chapters are the standard theorems concerning linear systems, existence and uniqueness of solutions, and dependence on parameters. The next three chapters, the heart of the book, deal with stability theory and some applications, such as oscillation phenomena, self-excited oscillations and the regulator problem of Lurie.<br>One of the special features of this work is its abundance of exercises-routine computations, completions of mathematical arguments, extensions of theorems and applications to physical problems. Moreover, they are found in the body of the text where they naturally occur, offering students substantial aid in understanding the ideas and concepts discussed. The level is intended for students ranging from juniors to first-year graduate students in mathematics, physics or engineering; however, the book is also ideal for a one-semester undergraduate course in ordinary differential equations, or for engineers in need of a course in state space methods.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Mao&#39;s War Against Nature: Politics and the Environment in Revolutionary China (Studies in Environment and History)</h2><p>In clear and compelling prose, Judith Shapiro relates the great, untold story of the devastating impact of Chinese politics on China&#39;s environment during the Mao years. Maoist China provides an example of extreme human interference in the natural world in an era in which human relationships were also unusually distorted. Under Mao, the traditional Chinese ideal of &#34;harmony between heaven and humans&#34; was abrogated in favor of Mao&#39;s insistence that &#34;Man Must Conquer Nature.&#34; Mao and the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s &#34;war&#34; to bend the physical world to human will often had disastrous consequences both for human beings and the natural environment. Mao&#39;s War Against Nature argues that the abuse of people and the abuse of nature are often linked. Shapiro&#39;s account, told in part through the voices of average Chinese citizens and officials who lived through and participated in some of the destructive campaigns, is both eye-opening and heartbreaking. Judith Shapiro teaches environmental politics at American University in Washington, DC. She is co-author, with Liang Heng, of several well known books on China, including Son of the Revolution (Random House, 1984) and After the Nightmare (Knopf, 1986). She was one of the first Americans to work in China after the normalization of U.S.-China relations in 1979.</p><p>Historians have well chronicled Mao Zedong's crimes against the people of China over his four decades of rule, but his crimes against the Chinese land have been less studied. Judith Shapiro, a historian at American University, tells that dark story with admirable thoroughness.<p> A central tenet of Maoist ideology was the rejection of both ancient Chinese tradition and modern Western science, both of which offered an ample store of evidence to suggest that rivers flow best when unimpeded, that biological diversity is a good and necessary thing. Instead, Mao Zedong insisted, the laws of historical materialism mandated that everything in creation be put into the service of the revolution: Forests had to be felled to make steel for China's industrial development, mountains had to be leveled to make room for agricultural fields, rivers had to be reversed in their courses to provide power and irrigation. Marshaling the people of China in campaigns to clear land and destroy grain-hungry birds, among other things, Mao remade the landscape in just a few years, ordering imperial-scale projects such as the Three Gorges Dam. His policies led to disaster, to deforestation, air and water pollution, and ultimately famine--but some of those policies are still in force.</p><p> Shapiro observes that Mao Zedong cannot be held entirely accountable for the destruction of China's land, water, and air; he had, after all, many willing deputies. Still, the political repression he put in place made resistance almost impossible--and even today, Shapiro writes in her impressive study of Mao's war on the environment, his actions have proved difficult to undo. "Until China confronts its uneasy Maoist legacy," the author concludes, "it may struggle fruitlessly to achieve a sustainable relationship with the natural world." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Under Mao, the traditional Chinese ideal of &#34;harmony between heaven and humans&#34; was abrogated in favor of Mao&#39;s insistence that &#34;Man Must Conquer Nature.&#34; Mao and the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s &#34;war&#34; to bend the physical world to human will often had disastrous consequences both for human beings and the natural environment.

Orthwood died soon after giving birth; one of the twins, Jasper, survived. Orthwood's illegitimate pregnancy sparked four related cases that came before the Northampton magistrates -- who coincidentally held court in the same tavern -- between 1664 and 1686. These interrelated cases and the decisions rendered in them are notable for the ways in which the Virginia colonists modified English common law traditions and began to create their own, as well as what they reveal about cultural and economic values in an Eastern shore community. Through these cases, the very reasons legal systems are created are revealed, namely, the maintenance of social order, the protection of property interests, the protection of personal reputation, and personal liberty.

Is selfhood a built-in feature of experience or rather socially constructed? How do we at all come to understand others? Does empathy amount to and allow for a distinct experiential acquaintance with others, and if so, what does that tell us about the nature of selfhood and social cognition? Does a strong emphasis on the first-personal character of consciousness prohibit a satisfactory account of intersubjectivity or is the former rather a necessary requirement for the latter?<br><br>Engaging with debates and findings in classical phenomenology, in philosophy of mind and in various empirical disciplines, Dan Zahavi's new book <em>Self and Other</em> offers answers to these questions. Discussing such diverse topics as self-consciousness, phenomenal externalism, mindless coping, mirror self-recognition, autism, theory of mind, embodied simulation, joint attention, shame, time-consciousness, embodiment, narrativity, self-disorders, expressivity and Buddhist no-self accounts, Zahavi argues that any theory of consciousness that wishes to take the subjective dimension of our experiential life serious must endorse a minimalist notion of self. At the same time, however, he also contends that an adequate account of the self has to recognize its multifaceted character, and that various complementary accounts must be integrated, if we are to do justice to its complexity. Thus, while arguing that the most fundamental level of selfhood is not socially constructed and not constitutively dependent upon others, Zahavi also acknowledges that there are dimensions of the self and types of self-experience that are other-mediated. The final part of the book exemplifies this claim through a close analysis of shame.<br></p><p><br>Dan Zahavi, <em>University of Copenhagen</em><br><br>Dan Zahavi is Professor of Philosophy and Director of Center for Subjectivity Research at the University of Copenhagen.

The exegetical work alone makes this book valuable for anyone interested in the phenomenological tradition and its contemporary relevance.

What are the main characteristics of Britain's peculiar constitutional arrangements? How has the British constitution altered in response to the changing nature of its state--from England, to Britain, to the United Kingdom? What impact has the UK's developing relations with the European Union caused? These are some of the questions that legal scholar Martin Loughlin investigates in this Very Short Introduction. He traces how the British constitution has grown organically, in response to changes in the economic, political, and social environment. By considering the nature and authority of the current British constitution, and placing it in the context of others, Loughlin reveals how the traditional idea of a constitution came to be retained, what problems have been generated as a result of adapting a traditional approach in a modern political world, and what the future holds for the British constitution. <br><br>About the Series:<br><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

The authors define curriculum as an academic plan developed in a historical, social, and political context. They identify eight curricular elements that are addressed, intentionally or unintentionally, in developing all college courses and programs. By exploring the interaction of these elements in context they use the academic plan model to clarify the processes of course and program planning, enabling instructors and administrators to ask crucial questions about improving teaching and optimizing student learning. <p>This revised edition continues to stress research-based educational practices. The new edition consolidates and focuses discussion of institutional and sociocultural factors that influence curricular decisions. All chapters have been updated with recent research findings relevant to curriculum leadership, accreditation, assessment, and the influence of academic fields, while two new chapters focus directly on learning research and its implications for instructional practice. A new chapter drawn from research on organizational change provides practical guidance to assist faculty members and administrators who are engaged in extensive program improvements.

It demonstrates that the variety of English expected at school differs from the interactional language that students use for social purposes outside of school, and provides a linguistic analysis of the challenges of the school curriculum, particularly for non-native speakers of English, speakers of non-standard dialects, and students who have little exposure to academic language outside of schools. <br><br><i>The Language of Schooling: A Functional Linguistics Perspective</i> builds on current sociolinguistic and discourse-analytic studies of language in school, but adds a new dimension--the framework of functional linguistic analysis. This framework focuses not just on the structure of words and sentences, but on how texts are constructed--how particular grammatical choices create meanings in the different kinds of texts students are asked to read and write at school. <br><br><i>The Language of Schooling: A Functional Linguistics Perspective</i><br><br>*provides a functional description of the kinds of texts students are expected to read and write at school;<br><br>*relates research from other sociolinguistic and language development perspectives to research from the systemic functional linguistics perspective;<br><br>*focuses on the increasing linguistic demands of contexts of advanced literacy (middle school through college);<br><br>*analyzes the genres typically encountered at school, with extensive description of the grammatical features of the expository essay, a gatekeeping genre for secondary school graduates;<br><br>*reviews the grammatical features of disciplinary genres in science and history; and<br><br>*argues for more explicit attention to language in teaching all subjects, with a particular focus on what is needed for the development of critical literacy.<br><br>This book will enable researchers and students of language in education to recognize how the grammatical and discourse features of the language of schooling construct the content areas, role relationships, and purposes and expectations of schools. It also will enable them to better understand the nature of language itself and how it emerges from and helps to maintain social structures and institutions, and to apply these understandings to creating classroom environments that build on the strengths students bring to school.</p><p><b>Mary J.

David CopperfieldNo Bio</p><h2>The Primacy of Politics: Social Democracy and the Making of Europe&#39;s Twentieth Century</h2><p>Political history in the industrial world has indeed ended, argues this pioneering study, but the winner has been social democracy - an ideology and political movement that has been as influential as it has been misunderstood. Berman looks at the history of social democracy from its origins in the late nineteenth century to today and shows how it beat out competitors such as classical liberalism, orthodox Marxism, and its cousins, Fascism and National Socialism by solving the central challenge of modern politics - reconciling the competing needs of capitalism and democracy. Bursting on to the scene in the interwar years, the social democratic model spread across Europe after the Second World War and formed the basis of the postwar settlement. This is a study of European social democracy that rewrites the intellectual and political history of the modern era while putting contemporary debates about globalization in their proper intellectual and historical context.</p><p>This book examines the history of social democracy from the late nineteenth century to today. It argues that social democracy has become the most successful ideology of the modern era by figuring out how to reap the benefits of free markets while protecting society from their most corrosive and destabilizing effects.Sheri Berman is an Associate Professor of Political Science at Barnard College, Columbia University.

Covering the diverse needs of both the academic and professional communities, this classic text will be a must have reference for all those in soil science and related fields.</p><p>Soils are natural bodies wherein inorganic components derived from geologic materials combine with organic materials produced by biological activity in ecosystems. The nearly infinite combinations of geologic materials and biological diversity of life on earth have produced a staggering array of chemical, physical, and biological reactions that over time have created the soils that we observe today. In the United States more than 23,000 kinds of soil are formally identified, and the number of soils in the world is not known. <p><i>Soil Genesis and Classification, Sixth Edition</i> builds on the strong foundations of this venerable soil science text to present the most current concepts on how soils are formed and sustained within the dynamic changes of ecosystem successions and climatic dynamics. The sixth edition has been fully revised and updated, incorporating more detailed data regarding specific examples of how soils have acquired various characteristics. Methods of communicating and analyzing spatial information have been expanded in light of the latest technological advances. Color plates have also been added to allow readers a better visualization of various soils.</p> <p><i>Soil Genesis and Classification, Sixth Edition</i> is a comprehensive work that meets the diverse range of needs from soil science students professionals in fields ranging from agriculture and ecology to civil engineering.

Arthur M. Eckstein challenges claims that Rome was an exceptionally warlike and aggressive state&#x2015;not merely in modern but in ancient terms&#x2015;by arguing that intense militarism and aggressiveness were common among all Mediterranean polities from ca 750 B.C. onwards.<br><br>In his wide-ranging and masterful narrative, Eckstein explains that international politics in the ancient Mediterranean world was, in political science terms, a multipolar anarchy: international law was minimal, and states struggled desperately for power and survival by means of warfare. Eventually, one state, the Republic of Rome, managed to create predominance and a sort of peace. Rome was certainly a militarized and aggressive state, but it was successful not because it was exceptional in its ruthlessness, Eckstein convincingly argues; rather, it was successful because of its exceptional ability to manage a large network of foreign allies, and to assimilate numerous foreigners within the polity itself. This book shows how these characteristics, in turn, gave Rome incomparably large resources for the grim struggle of states fostered by the Mediterranean anarchy&#x2015;and hence they were key to Rome's unprecedented success.</p><p>"A major contribution to the study of Roman imperialism and ancient international relations."&#x2015;John Rich, University of Nottingham<b>Arthur M.

R. F. Browning has been a Canon Residentiary of Blackburn Cathedral and of Christ Church Cathedral Oxford. He is now an honorary canon and an honorary priest in West Oxford. He was for thirteen years a lecturer in New Testament Studies at Cuddesdon College, Oxford, and at the Oxford University Department of Continuing Education. His books include <em>Commentary on St Luke's Gospel</em> (1960; 6th edition 1981), <em>Meet the New Testament</em> (1965), <em>The Anglican Synthesis</em> (1965), and <em>Handbook of the Ministry</em> (1985). In 2008 he was awarded the Cross of St Augustine of Canterbury for work in theological education.<br>In the field of biblical studies, the past ten years have seen continuing archaeological discoveries, new trends in biblical criticism, and the release of the full corpus of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Thus, it is entirely fitting that a new edition of a standard Bible dictionary appear. The first edition of The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary (under the title Harper's Bible Dictionary, LJ 1/96) was well received by scholars, students, and lay readers. This edition has been expanded and revised, with approximately 25 percent of the material either new or updated. The number of contributors has also increased, from 179 to 193. The work has retained the two-column format, with 16 single-column articles interspersed throughout (including "Art in the Biblical Period," "Jesus Christ," and "The Temple"), and it is well illustrated. Many of the longer articles include a brief bibliography (most of which have been updated from the first edition). Though not a flawless work (e.g., the article "Manasseh" treats only the 14th king of Judah but neither the patriarch nor the tribe of Israel that also bear that name), it is outstanding in terms of scholarship and writing. All biblical studies collections should have this new work (balanced by New Bible Dictionary, InterVarsity, 1996. 3d ed., which represents current evangelical scholarship), even if they already own the previous edition. Browning's (New Testament studies, Cuddleson Coll., Oxford) dictionary is different in several ways. It is the work of one person. Few of the articles are more than a page long (though "Jesus" merits two and a half pages). The only illustrations are four two-page black-and-white maps at the end of the volume, and the bibliography is limited to a one-page select list of titles. The tone of the writing is at times casual, and Browning makes rather blunt statements. For instance, he declares the Bible's report of the number of Israelites who left Egypt in the exodus?600,000 men plus women and children, according to the book of Exodus?"unbelievable." Browning is certainly knowledgeable regarding the Bible and biblical studies, and he offers some interesting observations: "Paul's converts were often on the margin of society...and women were attracted by being valued as persons." A good choice for libraries that need to round out a comprehensive collection.?Craig W.

Then this book is for you! In this book, the author explains everything you need to know from getting and installing the necessary tools to writing, compiling, deploying, and testing your very own operating system. By the time you are done you will have an operating system to call your own. And, don&#39;t worry about destroying your existing hardware and software environment as everything in this book is written with the intention of running in a virtualized environment. However, should you choose to do so, the author also explains how to deploy and test your new OS on bare-metal hardware as well. The first few chapters give a brief overview of how modern day computers work. In these chapters you will (re)learn everything from memory allocation, stacks, and bootloaders to low-level machine code and programming languages. After that, you will jump into downloading and installing the tools you will use for building your very own operating system. Here you will learn how to develop a bootloader and kernel just like modern day computers rely on for operating. The last few chapters will explain how to deploy and test your operating system as well as how to expand your OS to do more and even how to cross-compile your shiny new operating system for other devices such as the Raspberry Pi.

Suggesting that teachers need to know key aspects of grammar in order to teach writing more effectively, Weaver also argued that students need to be guided in learning and applying grammatical concepts as they revise and edit their writing. Attention to sentence structure and mechanics during the process of writing would result in better products. </p> <p>With <i>Teaching Grammar in Context</i>, Weaver extends her philosophy by offering teachers a rationale and practical ideas for teaching grammar not in isolation but in the context of writing. She begins by introducing some common meanings of "grammar" and provides a historical overview of traditional reasons for teaching grammar as a school subject. After examining those reasons, she questions them, citing decades of research which suggests that grammar taught in isolation has little, if any, effect on most students' writing. </p> <p>To lay the groundwork for a more effective approach, Weaver considers how preschoolers learn the basic structures of their native language and how second-language grammar is acquired. She goes on to suggest a research-based perspective on the concept of error and on the writing "errors" our students make, concluding with practical alternatives to what Lois Rosen has dubbed "the error hunt." Equally useful is Weaver's examination of the aspects of grammar on which we might focus as we guide our students in writing and revising sentences and in editing selected pieces. Her final chapter addresses the teaching of grammar from the perspective of learning theory. </p> <p>The appendix includes numerous sample lessons from Weaver's own teaching, illustrating the five broad topics suggested in the text: </p> <ul> <li>teaching concepts of subject, verb, clause, sentence, and related editing concepts </li> <li>teaching style through sentence combining and generating </li> <li>teaching sentence sense and style through manipulation of syntactic elements </li> <li>teaching the power of dialects and dialects of power </li> <li>teaching punctuation and mechanics for convention, clarity, and style. </li> </ul> <p><i>Teaching Grammar in Context</i> fills a long-standing gap in the literature on teaching writing. It will prove invaluable to all practicing and preservice teachers, especially those at the middle and high school levels, where grammar is taught most intensively. </p></p><p>With Teaching Grammar in Context, Weaver extends her philosophy by offering teachers a rationale and practical ideas for teaching grammar not in isolation but in the context of writing.

Reading Process &amp; Practice first appeared in 1988 and became widely known as the most authoritative, comprehensive, and definitive book of its kind. It helped teachers define reading in ways that support high-quality instruction. Connie once again led the way with the 1996 publication of the bestselling Teaching Grammar in Context and its companion Lessons to Share on Teaching Grammar in Context. Then she expanded and deepened her insights and specific teaching ideas in The Grammar Plan Book and Grammar to Enrich and Enhance Writing. In 1996, the Michigan Council of Teachers of English honored Weaver with the Charles C. Fries award for outstanding leadership in the profession. Connie was the Heckert Professor of Reading and Writing at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, and Professor Emerita of English at Western Michigan University. She passed away in July of 2018.</p></p><h2>Ancient China and its Enemies: The Rise of Nomadic Power in East Asian History</h2><p>This comprehensive history of the northern frontier of China through the first millennium B.C. details the formation of two increasingly distinct cultural areas: the sedentary Chinese and the northern nomads.

When people from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds listen to the same sermon, it is more than likely that they will not "hear" the same message. Preaching to Every Pew, based on extensive field research, takes on the challenge of preaching in such a context. <p>The authors map an approach to culture from four significant perspectives: ethnicity, class, displacement, and religious beliefs. They describe the significant ways in which culture influences human beings, detail how cultural influences affect and complicate communication in general, and preaching in particular, and then recommend practical strategies for improving communication in culturally diverse settings. Valuable both as a seminary text and as a text to help practicing pastors "re-tool" for more effective proclamation of the gospel.</p></p><p>James R.

Will you ask her to call her Aunt Maureen?&#x201d; She pronounced<br>it <i>ahhnt, </i>rather than like the insect. &#x201c;Maureen Miles. I&#x2019;m her father&#x2019;s sister<br>. . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>Oh, no.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Dave said. &#x201c;Of course. Hi. Sophia&#x2019;s, um, told me about you.<br><br>From Boston, right? I&#x2019;m Dave. Her . . .&#x201d; What? Boyfriend? Lover?<br>Bedroom- drawer guy? They&#x2019;d talked about a lot of things over the past<br>weeks, but they&#x2019;d never precisely defined what their relationship now was.<br>Maureen Miles didn&#x2019;t seem to care. There was more to her message.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you let her know that her father&#x2019;s back in the hospital?&#x201d;<br><br>Shit. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that,&#x201d; Dave said. &#x201c;Mass General again?&#x201d;<br><br>Another brief pause. &#x201c;Yes. The doctors have given him only a few days<br>this time, and he would like, very much, to see his daughter. I should think<br>she owes him at least that much&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Dave cut her off. &#x201c;With all due respect, ma&#x2019;am, do we live<br>in the same universe? Because in the reality- based one where I reside,<br>Sophia owes him <i>nothing.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s her father,&#x201d; the woman said.<br><br>&#x201c;He may have contributed his sperm to the creative process,&#x201d; Dave<br>said tartly, &#x201c;but in my opinion he lost the right to call himself <i>Daddy </i>a few<br>decades ago.&#x201d;<br><br>She was silent again for a moment, but she was just regrouping. She<br>hadn&#x2019;t given up. &#x201c;Please tell her that he&#x2019;s being moved into hospice in a<br>few days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give her the message,&#x201d; Dave said, a <i>but </i>heavy in his tone, and the<br>woman hung up without a thank- you.<br><br>He dropped the handset into the phone&#x2019;s cradle and flopped back<br>onto Sophia&#x2019;s pillows, staring up at the spinning ceiling fan.<br><br>From the bathroom, he heard the sound of the water shutting off, the<br>shower door opening. Sophia&#x2019;s melodic voice. &#x201c;We need to get moving if<br>we&#x2019;re going to make it to Encinitas by noon.&#x201d;<br><br>What? Dave lifted his head and aimed his voice toward the bathroom<br>door. &#x201c;Noon? Wait a minute, why?&#x201d;<br><br>She appeared in the doorway, gloriously naked, drying herself with a<br>towel, her wet hair slicked back from her face. She was one of those<br>women who were even more beautiful when not wearing makeup.<br><br>Or clothes.<br><br>It was hard to think or listen when Sophia was naked, and he&#x2019;d obviously<br>not heard her response to his question, because she gave him her <i>I&#x2019;m<br>repeating myself because you&#x2019;re staring at me blankly </i>smile and said, again,<br>&#x201c;The main parking lot&#x2019;ll fill up by noon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; Dave sat up, struggling to make sense of her words. &#x201c;Are we<br>talking about the same thing? The parking lot&#x2019;ll <i>fill up</i>? For a <i>flea </i>market?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Antique show,&#x201d; she corrected him, heading out of sight, back to the<br>sink, where she kept a collection of bottles and jars of lotion, each one of<br>them smelling sweeter than the last. If he hurried, he could watch her<br>smooth some onto her arms and legs, her stomach and breasts.<br><br>As he skidded to a stop in the bathroom, she met his eyes in the mirror.<br><br>&#x201c;You know, we don&#x2019;t have to go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want to.&#x201d; He opened the shower door and turned on the water. &#x201c;The<br>thrill of the hunt, the excitement of finding a treasure hidden in with the<br>trash, the hours tromping through the brain- meltingly hot sun with the four<br>million other people who helped us fill up the main parking lot before<br>noon, who are hoping to find the exact same perfect cabinet for the kitchen<br>before we do, so maybe we&#x2019;ll have to win a duel or probably a spelling bee<br>in order to gain ownership . . . I&#x2019;m totally there, T- H- E- R- E.&#x201d;<br><br>Sophia had turned around to look at him, her gaze traveling below his<br>waist, her lower lip caught between her teeth as she tried not to smile&#x2014;<br>and failed. &#x201c;You either <i>really </i>love antiques, or you&#x2019;re lying through your<br>teeth.&#x201d; She reached out and wrapped her fingers around him as she gave<br>up and laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go with lying through your teeth.&#x201d;<br><br>Dave laughed, too, as she stroked him, as she smiled up into his eyes.<br>&#x201c;Obviously I&#x2019;d anticipated a different morning agenda,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;But<br>I&#x2019;m a grown- up. I can multi- task. I can both be your antique- hunting partner<br><i>and </i>spend the day imagining all the ways I&#x2019;m going to make you come<br>after we get home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; she said, swaying closer, the tips of her breasts brushing his<br>chest as she pressed his erection against the softness of her stomach. &#x201c;Or<br>we can say the heck with the main parking area, and take the PITA shuttle<br>from the south lot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;South lot,&#x201d; he repeated, unable to keep himself from touching her, his<br>fingers sliding across her silky, clean, lotion- sweet skin. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a south lot?&#x201d;<br><br>Sophia nodded, then jumped up, wrapping her arms around his neck,<br>her legs around his waist, like a piggyback ride in reverse.<br><br>&#x201c;I love the south lot,&#x201d; Dave told her as he grabbed her to keep her<br>from slipping off him, her perfect derriere filling his hands. And God, this<br>was unlike any other piggyback ride he&#x2019;d ever given anyone, because she<br>shifted and pushed him hard and deep inside of her. &#x201c;Holy <i>shit.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>She pulled back to look at him, laughter lighting her face and making<br>her eyes sparkle and dance. &#x201c;New one, huh?&#x201d; she asked as she began to<br>move against him.<br><br>He nodded. &#x201c;Oh, yeah.&#x201d; His experience with sex, pre- Sophia, was<br>ridiculously limited, and she knew it because, well, he&#x2019;d told her the truth.<br><br>They&#x2019;d talked about a lot of things in those first few days A.S.&#x2014;after<br>Sacramento&#x2014;and while he hadn&#x2019;t been ready to go into full, gory detail<br>about his farce of a relationship with Kathy- slash- Anise, he <i>had </i>confessed<br>to Sophia that his full sexual oeuvre was limited to five interactions with<br>one woman who didn&#x2019;t particularly like him, even though she&#x2019;d pretended<br>otherwise.<br><br>Sophia hadn&#x2019;t fainted at that news, no doubt because her own baggage<br>was also quite cumbersome when it came to sex.<br><br>That first morning they&#x2019;d woken up in each other&#x2019;s arms, they&#x2019;d made<br>a promise to be honest in regard to their intimacy&#x2014;since it was a potential<br>minefield for both of them.<br><br>So, yes. Having sex standing up in the middle of the bathroom <i>was </i>a<br>new one for him. Although there really wasn&#x2019;t much he could do but stand<br>there holding her, the muscles in his arms and shoulders getting quite the<br>workout.<br><br>Which maybe meant he was a wimp, because she was petite and<br>didn&#x2019;t weigh more than a hundred pounds. But Dave was discovering that<br>holding on to a hundred- pound woman was a very different experience<br>than holding on to a hundred- pound woman while having sex with her.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, God,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Soph . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thumbs up or down?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, up,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;Big up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; she gasped, her breath warm against his ear. &#x201c;But feel free<br>to, you know, set me on the counter, by the sink, if you need to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a chance.&#x201d; Dave loved where his hands were, loved the sensation<br>of her legs and buttocks straining to push him more fully inside of her, but<br>when he shifted slightly to get a better grip, he discovered&#x2014;eureka!&#x2014;<br>there <i>was </i>something he could do besides simply stand there and not drop<br>her. He shifted again to hold most of her weight with his left arm, freeing<br>up his right hand to touch her again, with slightly better aim.<br><br>She sighed his name, and that, combined with the increased speed of<br>her rocking motion, was enough to bring him teetering to the edge of his<br>release, so he touched her harder, deeper, and she came with a moan and<br>a shudder that he loved as much as he loved his new drawer and closet<br>space. And in that fraction of a heartbeat, in the brief instant of time between<br>his knowing that he, too, was going to orgasm<i>&#x2014;now&#x2014;</i>and the deep<br>rush of mind- blowing pleasure that was already starting to surge through<br>his body, he remembered the phone call.<br><br>He&#x2019;d yet to tell Sophia that her father was in the hospital.<br><br>Dave came with a crash, with a shout&#x2014;&#x201c;God, I love you!&#x201d;&#x2014;pulling<br>her warm, pliant body more tightly against his, as she kept coming around<br>him, urging him, as always, to give her more, <i>more.<br><br></i>It should have diminished his pleasure&#x2014;his remembering the unhappy<br>message he&#x2019;d promised to deliver. It should have made him<br>ashamed for forgetting something so important in the first place.<br><br>It should have, but it didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Sophia&#x2019;s father was a rat- bastard and few besides his sister Maureen<br>would miss him when he was gone.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Sweet </i>Jesus,&#x201d; Dave said when he got his vocal cords working again.<br><br>Sophia just laughed, still clinging to him, nuzzling his neck, ankles<br>locked just beneath his butt.<br><br>Arms shaking, knees wobbly, he carried her out of the bathroom and<br>dumped her onto the bed, collapsing beside her. &#x201c;That was a solid thirty<br>on the fun scale.&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed again. &#x201c;When is it ever <i>not </i>a thirty?&#x201d;<br><br>In an effort to lighten things up&#x2014;mostly for his own sake, since the<br>simple fact that he was in a relationship with the woman of his dreams was<br>often enough to get him choked up&#x2014;Dave had suggested a rating system,<br>one to ten, for each new- to- him sexual position, of which there were many.<br><br>And yes, in all honesty, it was a way, too, for him to acknowledge his lack<br>of experience&#x2014;by addressing it straight on, with humor.<br><br>&#x201c;Sweetheart&#x201d;&#x2014;he opened his eyes to do his best Bogart&#x2014;&#x201c;for me, just<br>being in a room with you is a twenty.&#x201d;<br><br>She had her head propped up on one elbow so that she could look<br>down at him, her eyes wide and serious as her smile slowly faded.<br><br>&#x201c;You know that I love you, too, right?&#x201d; she finally murmured.<br><br>He gazed back at her for several long moments before he responded.<br><br>He waited until he knew for sure that his voice wouldn&#x2019;t vibrate with emotion.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to say that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; Sophia insisted. &#x201c;These past few months have been . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head. &#x201c;Sad, because of Nash dying, but . . .

He let her look long and hard into his eyes so<br>she would know that he meant it, that he accepted her words for what they<br>were&#x2014;something good, if not fairy- tale perfect.<br><br>Her mouth quirked up into a smile. &#x201c;You have no idea how hot you<br>are, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Dave laughed as he realized what she&#x2019;d said, and then rolled<br>his eyes. &#x201c;Yeah, actually,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I do.

Dr. Holt never settles for easy answers, and the questions he poses&#x2015;reflecting the frequent uncertainties of doctors and patients alike&#x2015;will leave readers thinking long after the final page is turned.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alice Cary, <em>BookPage</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Holt, who also holds a master&#x2019;s in fiction writing and a PhD in literature, is an excellent story teller...

Holt&#x2019;s unadorned prose and pitch-perfect dialogue contribute to the realism of these stories. At times they have the atmosphere of a hospital version of film noir, the narrator sounding as tough as Raymond Chandler&#x2019;s Philip Marlowe in his effort to be efficient and unflappable... Anyone who&#x2019;s considering becoming a doctor, or anyone who wants to know what&#x2019;s at the core of a doctor&#x2019;s initiation, should read this book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Susan Okie, <em>The Washington Post</em></strong></p><h2>China&#39;s Battle for Korea: The 1951 Spring Offensive (Twentieth-Century Battles)</h2><p><p>Between November 1950 and the end of fighting in June 1953, China launched six major offensives against UN forces in Korea. The most important of these began on April 22, 1951, and was the largest Communist military operation of the war. The UN forces put up a strong defense, prevented the capture of the South Korean capital of Seoul, and finally pushed the Chinese back above the 38th parallel. After China&#x2019;s defeat in this epic five-week battle, Mao Zedong and the Chinese leadership became willing to conclude the war short of total victory. <i>China's Battle for Korea</i> offers new perspectives on Chinese decision making, planning, and execution; the roles of command, political control, and technology; and the interaction between Beijing, Pyongyang, and Moscow, while providing valuable insight into Chinese military doctrine and the reasons for the UN&#x2019;s military success.</p></p><p>2015 Best Scholarly Publication Award for Original Research, Association of Chinese Professors of Social Sciences<p>Xiaobing Li is Professor and Chair of the Department of History and Geography and Director of the Western Pacific Institute at the University of Central Oklahoma.

Robert Adkinson's compendium of religious, philosophical, and cultural emblems from a variety of contexts reveals the universal power of these elemental images, bridging the&nbsp; gap between languages and civilizations all over the world. With illuminating commentary, Adkinson positions each image within its cultural context, from the early societies of the Egyptians, the&nbsp; Celts and the Maya, who used visual metaphors to explain natural phenomena and illustrate concepts of good and evil, to the iconography of Buddhism, Taoism, and Christianity as found in art and architecture, concluding with the complex spiritual puzzles of the mandala, sacred sex, and the Tarot.<br></p><p><b>Robert Adkinson </b>is a writer, translator, and editor working in Paris and London.<br></p><h2>Heart of the Christian Life: Thoughts on the Holy Mass</h2><p><p>The celebration of the Eucharist, in which Jesus Christ becomes present, is the center of the Catholic faith. This volume brings together substantive texts of the Holy Father on the many aspects and dimensions of the Mass and the Mystery of the Eucharist, a rich source for every Christian and a spur to reflection and personal prayer. Delivered in addresses and homilies to a wide variety of audiences , these reflections reveal the depth and breadth of Pope Benedict XVI&#x2019;s profound and life-long love for the Holy Eucharist.</p><p>A major theme throughout the works of Joseph Ratzinger, the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist is the Church&#x2019;s source of life, unity and fruitfulness. This theme has been carried deeply into his pontificate, as can be seen in this collection, which challenges the faithful to believe that by receiving Christ in Holy Communion, they are drawn not only into the very life of God, but into the community that is Christ&#x2019;s Body, the Church.</p></p><p><p><b>Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI </b>(Joseph Ratzinger) is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age. As Pope he authored the best-selling <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>; and prior to his pontificate, he wrote many influential books that continue to remain important for the contemporary Church, such as <i>Introduction to Christianity</i> and <i>The Spirit of the Liturgy</i>.</p>In these collected talks we find, one might say, the quintessential Benedict. Those who have read his <i>Jesus of Nazareth, The Spirit of the Liturgy</i>, or other of his works, will recognize here that amazing concord which he always achieves by bringing effortlessly together sound biblical scholarship (he ranges easily over Law, prophets, Gospels, and Epistles), deep love for the Eucharist, and an unflagging pastoral tone which addresses us laity in language that we can grasp. The selections are brief, hence the volume offers readers very accessible "devotional" reading. - --Thomas Howard, Author, <i>If Your Mind Wanders at Mass</i><br><br>Ignatius Press has done a remarkable service by drawing these talks and homilies by Benedict XVI into one rewarding volume on the importance of the Eucharist. Clear, deep, rich and engaging: All of these qualities mark the style of the Holy Father as a teacher, and anyone reading this book will discover the joy of Christian life and the beauty of Catholic worship in a new way. I highly recommend it. --+Charles J. Chaput, O.F.M.

A retired teacher, she says she now has more time to venture into the field of music, arranging for and playing fiddle as well as bowed and un-bowed psalteries, and dulcimers, and flutes. Bolton admitted to teaching herself to read music and play the piano when she was eight because she heard a beautiful piece of music (Beethoven&#x2019;s Moonlight Sonata) and wanted to play it. Eventually she did. Over the years she added other instruments, playing the violin in a youth orchestra in Germany when she was 13, then working her way through college as a folk singer accompanied by guitar, lute, and autoharp. More recently she played the flute with a trio in Santa Fe, New Mexico where she lived for twenty years. She also enjoys playing her tenor recorder with an early music group. 20 CELTIC TUNES FOR THE BOWED PSALTERY was her first venture into music publishing. It was so successful that she embarked on this second volume of Early Music. She admitted to having a hard time putting the music books together. &#x201c;There are so many good tunes!&#x201d; Early Music for the Bowed Psaltery is her second music book.

Pei, Philip Johnson, Louis Kahn,&nbsp;Richard Neutra, George Nelson, and dozens more&#x2014;is now published for the first time.<br><br> The story of midcentury architecture in America is dominated by outsized figures who were universally acknowledged as creative geniuses. Yet virtually unheard of is this intensive 1958&#x2013;59 study, conducted at the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at the University of California, Berkeley, that scrutinized these famous architects in an effort to map their minds. Deploying an array of tests reflecting current psychological theories, the investigation sought to answer questions that still apply to creative practice today: What makes a person creative? What are the biographical conditions and personality traits necessary to actualize that potential?&nbsp;<br><br>The study&#x2019;s findings have been gathered through numerous original sources, including questionnaires, aptitude tests, and interview transcripts, revealing how these great architects evaluated their own creativity and that of their peers. In <i>The Creative Architect,</i> Pierluigi Serraino charts the development, implementation, and findings of this historic study, producing the first look at a fascinating and forgotten moment in architecture, psychology, and American history.</p><p><b>Pierluigi Serraino</b>, AIA, is an architect, author, and educator. His work and writings have been published in professional and scholarly journals such as <i>Architectural Record</i>, <i>Architecture California</i>, the <i>Journal of Architectural Education</i>, and <i>Architectural Design</i> (UK).

In Serraino's telling, great architects are really true to themselves, burning with an inner sense of destiny and the rightness of their cause. But he avoids Ayn Randian cliches about the omnipotent designer, preferring to situate architectural creativity within a midcentury context. He does so convincingly."<br><b>&#x2014;James McCown, Architecture Boston<br><br></b>"What makes someone creative? The same question fascinates Pierluigi Serraino, an Italian-American architect practising in San Francisco whose book, <i>The Creative Architect: Inside the Great Midcentury Personality Study, </i>has refocused attention on that now almost forgotten UC Berkeley study. The 1950s study's research, findings and conclusions about creativity will still strike a chord today, just as they did when they were first released from 1959 onwards to an attentive American public, drawn by the many big names involved.<b>"<br><b>&#x2014;Shelley Gare, Australian Financial Review</b><br></b><br>&#x201c;Ever wonder what the secret sauce is for a successful creative career?

The study revealed that each of the celebrated architects had something in their backgrounds that they had to overcome: lack of money, repressive parents, or poor health. &#x2018;To declare in no uncertain terms the core trait of the creative person: The answer is courage,&#x2019; Serraino writes.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Mimi Zeiger, <i>Architect Magazine</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Over 22 hours of testing, scientists studied the personalities, neuroses, and inner conflicts of architects who are, even today, among the most famous on earth.

M. Pei, George Nelson, Louis Kahn and about 40 of their contemporaries. Drawing on interview transcripts, aptitude tests and other original sources, Serraino&#x2019;s intriguing book seeks to answer the question that researchers posed when the studies began: what accounts for artistic greatness? Though it&#x2019;s impossible to know for sure, this book offers plenty to ponder.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i><b>Monocle</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;Pierluigi Serraino creates a detailed, fascinating account of the forgotten moment in 1959 when 40 preeminent modern architects were summoned to the University of California&#x2019;s Institute of Personality Assessment and Research for a study that attempted to gauge the nature of creativity. The study featured a three-day barrage of psychological tests and interviews, including the arrangement of tiles, conformity studies, and proto-Meyers-Briggs evaluations. The participants were asked to rank one another&#x2019;s creative prowess before the study; Philip Johnson, A. Quincy Jones, and Eero Saarinen each ranked themselves first. Interview commentary on Richard Neutra noted that 'he almost literally thinks of himself as superman.' Not all were consumed by hubris; many were identified as nervous and self-effacing, and almost all were labeled colossal introverts. Serraino notes that the study revealed that it is 'much easier to determine the traits of the creative person than... the creative process.'

The empty-headed boys go fishing after their mother pushes them out of the house on a beautiful day. Wordplay abounds, such as when the boys both literally and figuratively miss the boat. Arnold's exaggerated artwork complements the hilarious text. Side characters serve either to trick Mac and Mac or attempt to help them figure out life. The series reads like an updated (and, well, smarter) version of Harry Allard's The Stupids. The authors' notes at the end provide historical context for the adventures. Arnold, Hamilton, and Weiss borrow from many international sources of classic fools' stories, and the citations are a nice touch. Kids will feel like they have the upper hand while also reveling in Mac and Mac's foibles, and they might even learn a thing or two about logical reasoning. Even Mac and Mac learn something by the end, but when it comes down to it, they're still the same old Noodleheads.

He documents the historical roots of devil worship in "black Masses," sexual orgies and other rites and practices. He views contemporary charges of Satanism against such flamboyant groups as the Church of Satan, founded by self-proclaimed Satanic high priest LaVey, as evolving from media hype and hysteria. A theologian quoted here notes "very little of what is currently being called Satanism is actually religious phenomena, let alone a religious movement." From his study of supposed satanic cults and their widely differing orientations, Lyons demonstrates only that people have emotional and psychological needs that provoke strange behaviors. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dirty Tricks, Revenge, and Getting Even: Anonymous Payback Methods for 2015</h2><p>This is the Ultimate Book on getting revenge in 2015.

His multifaceted analysis explains how the Amazon became the object of geopolitical rivalries, state planning, media coverage, popular fascination, and social conflict. In need of rubber, a vital war material, the United States spent millions of dollars to revive the Amazon&#39;s rubber trade. In the name of development and national security, Brazilian officials implemented public programs to engineer the hinterland&#39;s transformation. Migrants from Brazil&#39;s drought-stricken Northeast flocked to the Amazon in search of work. In defense of traditional ways of life, longtime Amazon residents sought to temper outside intervention. Garfield&#39;s environmental history offers an integrated analysis of the struggles among distinct social groups over resources and power in the Amazon, as well as the repercussions of those wartime conflicts in the decades to come.</p><p><p>Seth Garfield is Associate Professor of History at the University of Texas, Austin. He is the author of <i>Indigenous Struggle at the Heart of Brazil: State Policy, Frontier Expansion, and the Xavante Indians, 1937&#x2013;1988</i>, also published by Duke University Press.</p>"In equal measure environmental, economic, and diplomatic history, Seth Garfield's <i>In Search of the Amazon </i>is much more than the sum of its parts. With clear prose and sharp analysis, Garfield's wonderful new book is a model for how to write the social history of nature, placing the great, wondrous Amazon at the heart of America's transnational twentieth century."&#x2014;<b>Greg Grandin</b>, author of<i> Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Forgotten Jungle City</i><br><br>"In this path-breaking study, Seth Garfield explores one of the most significant U.S. interventions in Amazonia. During World War II, the United States was desperate for rubber after losing access to Asian markets. In alliance with Brazil, the U.S. government embarked on an aggressive initiative to jump-start the Amazon rubber trade. Garfield masterfully recasts U.S.-Amazonian relations, revealing the wartime roots of the ideological and bureaucratic structures that have shaped modern Amazonia."&#x2014;<b>Susanna B. Hecht</b>, author of <i>The Scramble for the Amazon and the </i>Lost Paradise<i> of Euclides da Cunha</i><br><br>"Seth Garfield's extraordinary book reflects an enormous amount of research, knowledge, and thought about the Amazon. Besides recounting a fascinating chapter of World War II, Garfield places the history of the Amazon within a grid of political, social, and economic concerns that transcend the region's borders but are ultimately modulated by its particular circumstances of settlement and exploitation. He demonstrates the importance of wartime events in shaping subsequent disputes over the fate of the rain forest."&#x2014;<b>Barbara Weinstein</b>, author of <i>The Amazon Rubber Boom, 1850&#x2013;1920</i><br><br>"The book is engagingly written and packed full of information and excellent illustrations. . . . It will appeal especially strongly to those interested in U.S. involvement in Latin America before the Cold War. By placing U.S. intervention in Amazonian and Brazilian histories, Garfield recounts another chapter in the making of this enigmatic region that is the wartime roots of the ideological and administrative structures that have shaped the place today." (Mark Harris <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"[Garfield] succeeds best as a straightforward storyteller in the best tradition of talented historians." (Angus Wright <i>Environmental History</i>)<br><br>"Garfield is to be commended for shedding so much light on the cultural and eonomic history of the Amazon in the twentieth century. This book is a must have for all those interested in development policy in the Amazon." (Nigel Smith <i>Journal of Historical Geography</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;I highly recommend this book for its systematic and nuanced treatment of a region in flux. Garfield traces important precursors of contemporary inter-regional migration, land conflict, environmental change, and regional development policies. Amazon specialists will enjoy the meticulous archival work, and geographers will appreciate the focus on environmental history and political ecology. Those with general Latin American interests will learn about an important but often overlooked chapter in regional change.&#x201d; (Brian J. Godfrey <i>Journal of Latin American Geography</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This thoughtful, well-rounded book is, then, an invaluable addition to the English language historiography of the Amazon that remedies a gap in the extant literature. It also foregrounds an aspect of the war effort far from the battlefields that made an important, if largely unacknowledged, contribution to Allied victory for which participating Brazilian rubbers tappers could retrospectively be proud.&#x201d; (Philip Chrimes <i>International Affairs</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Garfield makes an important contribution to Brazilian historiography.... [He] combines thorough research in US and Brazilian government documents and contemporary publications with discerning use of labor and criminal court cases and oral histories with rubber migrants.&#x201d; (Thomas D. Rogers <i>Hispanic American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Although this may seem like well-traveled historiographical territory, Garfield finds new information to tap and synthesize. Whereas most books on the Amazon focus on a single topic ... &nbsp;the strength and novelty of Garfield&#x2019;s work is his focus on the convergence of all of these elements and more. Garfield&#x2019;s social and environmental approach means that he does not focus solely on the thoughts and actions of policy makers. Instead, he puts labor and nature at the center of the narrative to show how the Amazon was built from below. Garfield&#x2019;s book successfully merges global, national, and local history.&#x201d; (Myrna Santiago <i>Labor</i> 2015-11-01)</p><h2>The Bertie Project</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Alexander McCall Smith is the author of over eighty books on a wide array of subjects, including the award-winning The No.1 Ladies&#39; Detective Agency series.

At least two of this last group were present early that evening&#x2014;Angus Lordie, portrait painter and owner of the dog, Cyril, and his friend, Matthew, proprietor of a small art gallery on Dundas Street, husband of Elspeth, and father of the robust and increasingly rumbustious triplets, Tobermory, Rognvald, and Fergus. Cyril, the only dog in Scotland to have a gold tooth, and the only dog anywhere to have been trained to lift his leg at the mention of the controversial conceptual art award, the Turner Prize, was also there, lying contentedly beneath the table at which Matthew and Angus sat. Underneath this table was to be seen an empty metal bowl, licked clean of the dark stout poured into it only ten minutes earlier, and the consumption of which had induced Cyril&#x2019;s state of somnolent contentment.<br><br>&#x201c;Your dog,&#x201d; observed Matthew, &#x201c;really is a most peculiar creature. I&#x2019;ve never quite worked him out, you know. He keeps looking at me in a distinctly disconcerting way.&#x201d;<br><br>Angus glanced down at Cyril. Although one of the dog&#x2019;s eyes was closed, he saw that the other, half-open, was focused on Matthew&#x2019;s feet.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s as if he had something against me,&#x201d; Matthew continued. &#x201c;Some canine grudge perhaps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t think Cyril dislikes you. Quite the opposite, in fact.&#x201d; Angus smiled at Matthew. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that he&#x2019;s always had this thing about your ankles.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He nipped me,&#x201d; said Matthew accusingly. &#x201c;Remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. That was when he couldn&#x2019;t control himself any further. He yielded to temptation.&#x201d; Angus paused, ready to defend his dog. &#x201c;We all have our temptations, don&#x2019;t we? Some hidden desire, something we&#x2019;re perhaps a bit ashamed of. Nobody&#x2019;s immune to that.&#x201d; He paused again, before concluding, &#x201c;Chocolate . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew stared at Angus. He blushed. He had yielded to temptation only that afternoon, eating an entire bar of expensive Belgian chocolate bought by his assistant, Pat, as a birthday present for Elspeth. The chocolate had been entrusted to him, beautifully wrapped, for delivery to Elspeth, and he had sat and gazed at it, struggling with temptation, until at last he had succumbed. He had then eaten it in a single sitting when Pat went to post some letters, afterwards concealing the wrapping in the drawer of his desk. He had told himself that he would replace it in good time and that Elspeth would never know. But it was, he later decided, an entirely shameful thing to do&#x2014;no different from the act of a postman who steals a parcel, or a charity collector who pockets donations. Was it possible that Angus had guessed what he had done? That seemed so unlikely, and yet why else would he suddenly bring chocolate into the conversation?<br><br>He dismissed his scruples; it was hardly anything to get into a fankle over, hardly an issue at all . . . chocolate was a fungible, after all; something that could be replaced by more of the same. A fankle&#x2014;the Scots word seemed just right for its purpose, as so many Scots words did; a fankle was a mess, a state of confusion, sometimes leading to a stramash&#x2014;another useful Scots word&#x2014;and it was something one sought to avoid if at all possible.<br><br>Angus raised his glass to his lips. Having broached the topic of temptation, he was keen to abandon the subject. He himself experienced the occasional temptation&#x2014;nothing serious, of course, and barely anti-social&#x2014;but he was not sure that he would actually own up to such thoughts. Better, though, to think about something else altogether, which was, of course, a recommended way of tackling temptation in the first place.<br><br>But it was Matthew who moved the conversation on. &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Be that as it may, have you seen the plans for that new building?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus had, and sighed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think . . .&#x201d; he began, and then stopped. There was not much one could add, he felt, to the charges of gross Philistinism that had already been levelled at the developers.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said Matthew, &#x201c;you&#x2019;d think, wouldn&#x2019;t you? How�ever, I just don&#x2019;t have the energy to protest. I know I should; I know we should all rise up as one and flood the council with objections, but do they care? Does anyone actually imagine they give any weight to the likes of us, Angus? Les citoyens?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus thought for a moment, and then answered, &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So perhaps we should just give the matter a Gallic shrug . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Angus looked puzzled. &#x201c;A Gallic shrug?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The French are always shrugging,&#x201d; explained Matthew. &#x201c;You ask their view on things and they give a sort of insouciant shrug, as if to say that these things happen and they, at least, are completely unsurprised.&#x201d;<br><br>Angus knew what Matthew meant. He remembered a visit that he and Domenica had been paid by a French anthropologist a few months previously. The topic of French politics had cropped up in the conversation&#x2014;there was a long and crippling strike in France, with the government digging in against virtually everybody&#x2014;and the French visitor had simply shrugged. Pouf! he had said, adding, for clarification, Bif!<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps a shrug is not such a bad response,&#x201d; Angus said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the alternative? Getting all steamed up? Hot under the collar? You end up being angry&#x2014;outraged even&#x2014;but does that actually do any good?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew himself was about to shrug, but stopped in time. One could not pronounce on shrugs with a shrug. &#x201c;I suppose that a shrug indicates acceptance,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Which is what we should all cultivate,&#x201d; added Angus. &#x201c;Those who accept things are calmer, more resolved . . . and, I imagine, live much longer than those who rail against them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; said Matthew.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t abide moaning,&#x201d; said Angus, taking a sip of his beer. &#x201c;Moaning gets us nowhere. It confirms the moaner in his state of discontent, and it irritates those who have to listen to the complaints.&#x201d; He paused, and looked enquiringly at Matthew. &#x201c;Have I told you about my knee?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re having knee trouble?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A bit,&#x201d; said Angus. He looked at his beer glass, half full, with an expression of regret. &#x201c;I can only have one beer; you know&#x2014;because of my knee.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew frowned. &#x201c;Because of your knee?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus told him. &#x201c;You see what happened,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;is this . . .&#x201d;<br><br>*<br><br>News of Bruce<br><br>&#x201c;I first noticed it,&#x201d; said Angus, &#x201c;when I was driving up to St. Fillans. We have friends there, you see. Actually, she&#x2019;s some sort of cousin of Domenica&#x2019;s, and he used to manage a branch of the Bank of Scotland in the days when banks had proper managers in their branches&#x2014;somebody you could actually speak to.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remember our wonderful, solid, Presbyterian banks, Angus?&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Who wrecked our banks? Who actually did it? And I don&#x2019;t mean who lost the money by gambling on toxic mortgages and things like that, but who actually decreed that we shouldn&#x2019;t be able to speak to anybody if we phoned the branch? Or who said that banks needn&#x2019;t answer letters their customers wrote to them? Who ended the idea that banks actually supported people through rough times? Who ended all that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;People down in the City of London,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Avari�cious, arrogant people. I have a list of them somewhere. I cut it out of the newspaper. But, as I was saying . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course&#x2014;as you were saying.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were driving up to St. Fillans, going by way of Comrie. You know that back road that goes from Braco&#x2014;up over the hills?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew thought for a second before he remembered. As a sixteen-year-old boy he had gone to cadet camp during the summer and they had been driven in an ancient green army truck along that winding road, half looking forward to, half dreading the experience ahead: the tepid, frequently cold, showers, the rough camaraderie of the Nissen huts, the bullying (both subtle and unsubtle), the shouting and the crudity of males living in close proximity to one another for a week or more. &#x201c;Past Cultybraggan Camp?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Almost,&#x201d; said Angus. And he, too, remembered what that had been like in his own day. For a moment there was an additional bond between them, a bond that surpassed the ordinary ties of friendship, a bond based on a shared tribal experience. He continued, &#x201c;It was on that road, just as it begins to drop down sharply towards Comrie&#x2014;that&#x2019;s when I felt this pain in my knee. I thought I&#x2019;d pulled something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You often don&#x2019;t notice it when you actually pull the muscle,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;Then later on the pain starts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was quite intense,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;It was a sharp, insistent pain. Quite bad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it got steadily worse after we got to St. Fillans. That night I found it difficult to bend my knee at all. It was hard to get into bed&#x2014;I had to sit on the edge of the mattress and then swing the useless leg up. It was far from easy.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew shook his head in sympathy. &#x201c;Poor you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were due to come back to Edinburgh the following afternoon, but we cut our trip short and drove back the next morning. Domenica drove, in fact, as I couldn&#x2019;t move my leg. It was that painful.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew waited. He was thinking of Cultybraggan Camp and the generations of young men who had passed through it, for some of whom, of course, it had been the prelude to real conflict, to war with real explosives rather than the fireworks their instructors used to simulate explosions.<br><br>Angus continued his story. &#x201c;I saw my doctor in Edinburgh and he prescribed a pretty strong anti-inflammatory. Cyril had something similar from the vet when he caught his front paw in a drain cover. It did the trick for me. I also had a blood test.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d; prompted Matthew.<br><br>Angus looked morose, and Matthew wondered whether he was about to hear bad news; Angus did not look unwell, but then seriously ill people could often look perfectly healthy.<br><br>&#x201c;Gout,&#x201d; muttered Angus.<br><br>Matthew was relieved. &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At least . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He did not finish.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no joke,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;People make light of it, you know. They know that gout often goes for the big toe, and they find that amusing, for some reason. But it can flare up in other joints.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew started to grin, but checked himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, the diagnosis is not definite,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Apparently the only way in which you can really confirm gout is to stick a needle into the joint and see if there&#x2019;s any sign of uric acid crystals.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew, being squeamish, made a face.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s crystals that cause it,&#x201d; Angus continued. &#x201c;They form if your uric acid level is too high. They&#x2019;re shaped like needles&#x2014;hence the pain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And how do they treat it?&#x201d; asked Matthew.<br><br>Angus&#x2019;s face fell again. &#x201c;There are pills you can take,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They neutralise the uric acid. But you can also treat it by avoiding the foods that cause it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, there you are,&#x201d; said Matthew.<br><br>&#x201c;Which means cutting out everything I like the most,&#x201d; Angus said. &#x201c;Seafood, steak, red wine and . . .&#x201d; He pointed to his glass of beer. &#x201c;This stuff too.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew sympathised. &#x201c;Oh, bad luck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was given a leaflet published by the British Gout Society,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;It tells you about all the foods you have to avoid&#x2014;or, if you must, eat in moderation.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew could not help but imagine meetings of the British Gout Society. &#x201c;The British Gout Society,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;Do you think they have an annual dance, like other societies?&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;Can you imagine how much fun that would be?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus looked at him reproachfully. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t find that at all funny,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And anybody can get it, you know. Not just men who drink port in clubs . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew assumed a serious expression. &#x201c;Of course. Sorry.&#x201d; The problem, he thought, was that so much humour involved human misfortune of one sort or another, and now that same human misfortune was out of bounds&#x2014;interdicted by self-appointed guardians of sensitivity. There was somebody to be offended by everything, he thought, which left little room for laughter.<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t making light of it, Angus. It&#x2019;s just that the name of the society . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Angus waved a hand. &#x201c;No, I know that. And I&#x2019;m not hyper-sensitive. But I don&#x2019;t think people should make light of gout. People don&#x2019;t laugh at other conditions.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew knew Angus was right, and decided that another change of subject was called for.<br><br>&#x201c;Bruce,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I saw him the other day, you know. He&#x2019;s back in circulation&#x2014;with a new Australian girlfriend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Poor girl,&#x201d; said Angus.<br><br>Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;If sympathy is called for,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;it should be directed towards Bruce. He&#x2019;s the one I feel sorry for.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I find that hard to believe,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Poor girl. Does she have any idea what he&#x2019;s like?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suspect she does,&#x201d; replied Matthew. &#x201c;If I had to describe her eyes, I think I&#x2019;d use the expression wide open.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Angus. &#x201c;Doe-eyed?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Far from it.&#x201d;</p><h2>Machiavelli in Hell</h2><p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize<br> &nbsp;<br> In this intellectual biography, Sebastian de Grazia presents a new vision of Machiavelli that evokes, with uncanny precision, the great Florentine thinker&#x2019;s presence. After providing an engrossing account of Machiavelli's childhood and the period following his imprisonment and torture, the book turns to an examination of <i>The Prince</i>. The details of Machiavelli&#x2019;s life never cease to weave in and out of the narrative, as we read how his ideas gather power and coalesce into a unified vision of humankind and the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;De Grazia&#x2019;s achievement is to present a totally comprehensive view of Machiavelli mediated entirely through Machiavelli's own language.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Journal of Modern History</i></p><p>This intellectual biography of the 16th century Italian quotes exclusively from Machiavelli&#39;s own words rather than quoting others who commented upon him. In this way de Grazia, a professor at Rutgers, paints a colorful portrait of the man entirely in the context of his time. In The Prince Machiavelli had famously examined the dilemma of the ruler who must find a resolution between political necessity and ethical behavior. By thus inventing &#39;realpolitik&#39; Machiavelli entered the language of political discourse, and got himself rather a bad name. De Grazia&#39;s book, which won a Pulitzer Prize, goes some way to rehabilitating him, suggesting that his immoral means were put to good political ends.&#34;A model of how intellectual biography should be done.&#34;--Joseph Frank</p><h2>Seppuku: A History of Samurai Suicide</h2><p><b>This first comprehensive history in English of Japanese ritual suicide offers both action-packed stories that read like fiction, and invaluable scholarship - now in paperback.</b><br><br>This impeccably researched survey looks at seppuku (or hara-kiri, as it's more commonly known outside Japan) from ancient to modern times.

As pundits increasingly ponder "how Hollywood fails history," Robert Toplin counters with a provocative alternative approach to this enduring debate over the portrayal of history in film.<br><br>Toplin focuses on movies released over the past sixteen years&#x2014;during which twelve historical films won the Oscar for Best Picture&#x2014;and argues that critics often fail to recognize the unique ways that fictional films communicate important ideas about the past. A trenchant extension of his highly regarded <i>History by Hollywood</i>, Toplin's new work establishes commonsense ground rules for improving critical analysis in this area. Citing films like <i>Gladiator</i> and <i>Braveheart</i>, <i>Gandhi</i> and <i>Nixon</i>, he underscores the pressures placed on filmmakers to simplify and alter historical fact to conform to the demands of an extraordinarily expensive mass medium.<br><br>Toplin demonstrates how a historical epic like Glory may contain "creative adjustments" that worry historians but shows how its distortions communicate broader and deeper truths about the Civil War experiences of African Americans&#x2014;just as <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> presented little factual detail about World War II and yet effectively conveyed the experience of combat. He also shows how other films&#x2014;such as <i>Mississippi Burning</i>, <i>Amistad</i>, and <i>The Hurricane</i>&#x2014;contain so many elements of fictional excess and oversimplification that they deserve the criticism they receive. <br><br>Toplin deliberately steers a middle course between tradition-minded critics who castigate films for artistic liberties and cinema scholars wedded to pure aesthetics. He also draws upon his own experiences in film production and takes direct aim at recent writing about film dominated by jargonistic theory and empty rhetoric. He urges film studies scholars to move beyond their preoccupation with formal aesthetics and recognize that, in historical films, content does matter.<br><br>In engaging prose that will appeal to any moviegoer, <i>Reel History</i> helps build bridges between defenders and detractors of history-by-Hollywood and enlarges our understanding of film as a communicator of truths about the human condition.</p><p>"Without question most Americans today learn&#x2014;-or mislearn-&#x2014;history by watching movies.

Describing his childhood in the Bengali countryside and his youth in Calcutta&#x2014;and telling the story of modern India from his own fiercely independent viewpoint&#x2014;Chaudhuri fashions a book of deep conviction, charm, and intimacy that is also a masterpiece of the writer's art.</p><p><b>Nirad C.

Chaudhuri moved to England in 1970. In 1992 Queen Elizabeth II conferred upon him the title of Honorary Commander of the British Empire.<br><br><b>Ian Jack</b> was the editor of&nbsp;<i>The Independent on Sunday</i>&nbsp;and of&nbsp;<i>Granta</i>. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Country Formerly Known as Great Britain</i>&nbsp;and he writes regularly for&nbsp;<i>The Guardian</i>.Intensely rational, Chaudhuri, a Bengali and author of Thy Hand, Great Anarch! , describes his native country with the intent that "one part of this world may still retain some curiosity about the combination of man and geography which has worn out the British Empire." The autobiography yields a dense, absorbing account of Hindu boyhood (he was born in 1897) in a small village in what is now Bangladesh. Careful observations illuminate a waning culture: "A Hindu . . . accepts the first wail of birth as the leitmotiv of existence and manages . . . to lead a mock-turtle's life during the whole of it." Chaudhuri concludes with intricate analyses of the intellectual history of India before independence, seen in the context of its political and social history (from the Dravidians through the Raj); its religion--the "reformed" Hinduism of Swami Vivekananda; and Bengali literature. Chaudhuri's judgments, often surprising, are those of a world citizen; his scholarliness is humbling. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Mother&#39;s Day Mishap (A Tess and Tilly Cozy Mystery)</h2><p>If you love small towns, endearing relationships, food, animals, and a touch of murder, you will love this new mystery series by Kathi Daley, author of the popular Zoe Donovan Cozy Mystery Series.

He was completely unaware that his command lay directly in the path of a major Allied thrust: the September 17, 1944, launch of the largest airborne and glider operation in the history of warfare. Codenamed Operation <i>Market Garden</i>, it was intended to outflank the German West Wall and &#x201c;bounce&#x201d; the Rhine at Arnhem, from where the Allies could strike into the Ruhr, Nazi Germany's industrial heartland. Such a move could have ended the war.</p><p> However, <i>Market Garden</i> and the battle for Arnhem were a disaster for the Allies. Put together in little over a week and lacking in flexibility, the operation became an all-or-nothing race against time. The plan to link the airborne divisions by pushing an armored division up a sixty-five-mile corridor was optimistic at best, and the British drop zones were not only too far from Arnhem Bridge, but also directly above two recuperating SS Panzer divisions.

We fully entrust the care of our bodies to the medical profession, often taking its solutions and judgments as gospel. But what role, if any, should our Christian faith play in all this? <br><br>In <i>Reclaiming the Body,</i> a physician and a theologian take a critical look at some of the assumptions we draw from the medical profession and explore what theology has to say about medicine, our bodies, our health, and the Body of Christ. The authors deal with such issues as suffering, caring for the sick, children and reproductive technologies, medicine and the poor, our obsession with physical perfection, and death and dying.</p><p><b>Joel Shuman </b>(Ph.D., Duke University) teaches moral theology at King's College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He is a frequent public speaker, the author of numerous articles about theology and medicine, and coauthor of <i>Heal Thyself: Spirituality, Medicine, and the Distortion of Christianity. </i><br><br><b>Brian Volck, M.D., </b>is a pediatrician. He teaches an elective on literature and medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, and his essays, narrative nonfiction, and poetry have appeared in such publications as D<i>oubleTake, America, </i>and <i>St. Anthony Messenger.</i><i>Starred Review.</i> Shuman, an ethicist, and Volck, a pediatrician, are on a mission to persuade Christians to stop worshiping the medical establishment and to start "using medicine as if God mattered." It is easy to put medicine in the place that only God should occupy: "The medical project of controlling life and defeating death is attractive... because a denial of our own mortalities and a desire to be in control is very near the center of our own disordered desires." Christian theology, however, teaches that "because we come from God, belong to God, and are destined finally to return to God, we need not fight without restraint to control all the circumstances of our existence, or to preserve our lives as they near their end." As they develop this theme through literature, contemporary stories and theological reflection, the authors affirm the goodness of the human body, the importance of the church as the gathered body of Christ and the necessity of hospitality toward the world's helpless and suffering. Brilliantly reasoned and artfully written, this quotable book should reach well beyond its obvious market of medical and spiritual caregivers to engage anyone concerned about human values in a technological age. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was almost completely unprepared to do so, and this was particularly evident in its ability to project power and to control the vast colonial spaces of Africa. Following the uprisings of March 1961 in the north of Angola, Portugal poured troops into the colony as fast as its creaking logistic system would allow; however, these new arrivals were not competent and did not possess the skills needed to fight a counterinsurgency. While counterinsurgency by its nature requires substantial numbers of light infantry, the force must be trained in the craft of fighting a &#x2018;small war&#x2019; to be effective. <br><br>The majority of the arriving troops had no such indoctrination and had been readied at an accelerated pace. Even their uniforms were hastily crafted and not ideally suited to fighting in the bush. In reoccupying the north and addressing the enemy threat, Portugal quickly realized that its most effective forces were those with special qualifications and advanced training. Unfortunately there were only very small numbers of such elite forces. The maturing experiences of the Portuguese and their consequent adjustments to fight a counterinsurgency led to the development of specialized, tailored units to close the gaps in skills and knowledge between the insurgents and their forces. This book is about the Fuzileiros or Portuguese marines, a naval force that operated in the riverine littorals of Africa and that was both feared by the enemy and loved by those loyal to Portugal. <br><br>The Fuzileiros underwent one of the longest and most physically demanding specialist infantry training regimes in the world, lasting some forty-two weeks. Perhaps only 15 to 35 percent of the inductees eventually passed the course and were awarded the traditional and highly coveted navy blue beret. When deployed to Africa, they underwent further acclimation for weeks until they were able to move through the slime and mud of a riverbank with ease, as their lives depended on it. They became experts at riverine warfare and regularly ranged inland on extended patrols, many of which are recounted here. They were comfort able with the uncomfortable fighting environment, and this ability translated into an unpredictability that the enemy feared. This book is the story of how they came to be formed and organized, the initial teething difficulties, and their unqualified successes.</p><p>John P.

Hailed from the beginning of his career for a poetry provocative in its candor, uncompromising in its inquiry, and at once rigorous and innovative in its attention to craft, Phillips has in the course of eight critically acclaimed collections generated a sustained meditation on the restless and ever-shifting myth of human identity. Desire and loss, mastery and subjugation, belief and doubt, sex, animal instinct, human reason: these are among the lenses through which Phillips examines what it means to be that most bewildering, irresolvable conundrum, a human being in the world.</p><p>Phillips's sensibility as he questions morality, psychology, and our notions of responsibility is as startlingly original as the poems themselves, whose exacting standards for the line's flexibility and whose argument for a versatile, more muscular syntax bring to American poetry "something not unlike a new musical scale" (<i>The Miami Herald</i>). <i>Quiver of Arrows </i>is the record of a powerful vision that, in its illumination of the human condition, has established itself as a necessary step toward our understanding of who we are in the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><p>Praise for author Carl Phillips:</p><p>"Singing the music of mythology, history and philosophy, [Phillips's] poems are delicately crafted to sound like common speech even though there is nothing pedestrian about them.

Using pressure created by super-heated steam, the pressure cooker can cut cook times by 70 percent, meaning dinner is on the table faster, and with significantly less energy use. Your dinner will be more nutrient-rich because vitamins and other good things won't be lost in evaporating steam. And it will taste delicious and succulent because none of the food's moisture has been allowed to escape. Finally, today's modern pressure cooker has been re-engineered for safety and ease of use, including the development of the electric pressure cooker.</p><p></p><p>Because no moisture evaporates during cooking, conventional stovetop recipes do not work in the pressure cooker. For success, the pressure cooker requires different food to liquid ratios and because of that superheated pressure, cook times are very precise. With this comprehensive guide, the busy cook can use fresh ingredients to create more than 700 tasty recipes developed for and scrupulously tested and retested for the pressure cooker.</p><p></p><li>Chapters on Poultry, Pork, Beef &amp; Veal, Lamb &amp; Game, and Seafood include Zinfandel-braised short ribs that cook in just 30 minutes, herb-stuffed whole turkey breast and braised lamb shanks ready in 25 minutes, and baby back ribs that pressure-cook in just 15 minutes.</li><li>Individual chapters on grains, beans, rice dishes (including risotto and breakfast rice), potatoes, chili, and tomato sauces (with and without meat), as well as on soups, vegetables, desserts, making your own baby food, and much more.</li><li>An introductory chapter explains the ins and outs of the pressure cooker, with valuable tips and advice.

Despite a series of mishaps, he is one Lucky Dog!</p></p><p><p><strong>Ellen Fischer </strong>was born in St. Louis. Following graduation from Washington University, she taught children with special needs and then ESL at a Jewish Day School. She lives in Greensboro, North Carolina with her husband. They have three children.</p><p>"<strong>Do we need another juvenile Hanukkah book? The answer is definitively yes, in the case of this lovely new dog-centric book which gives a unique perspective on the holiday.</strong> An adorable newly adopted puppy has been res�cued from an animal shelter on the first night of Hanukkah and joins all his new family's celebrations. Latke manages to continuously behave somewhat inappropriately, thinking the delicious treats on the table and counter are for him, and the presents are his to unwrap. Fortunately, despite this, he is treated with lots of affection by his new family. Hoping he won't be sent back to the animal shelter, he tries to improve his behavior. <br> <br> Many symbols of the holiday appear in the colorful and age-appropriate illustrations: donuts, menorah, gifts wrapped in Jewish star wrapping paper, latkes, dreidels, applesauce, candles, and chocolate money abound. The illustrator loves to draw foxes and dogs, and she conveys warm feelings toward the sensitive pet. The Hebrew <em>sufganiyot</em> is used to describe donuts and the Yiddish words <em>gelt</em> and <em>latkes</em> also appear. On the page following the story there is a paragraph detailing the history and customs of Hanukkah. <br> <br> This sweet holiday story, told with humor, is perfect for the youngest listener through beginning reader." -- <em>Jewish Book World</em></p> (<i>Magazine</i>)<br><br><p>"A family rescues a golden brown dog from the animal shelter and names it Latke in honor of the beginning of Hanukkah. Each successive night, he gets in a bit of trouble, eating a platter of <em>sufganiyot </em>(fried donuts), tearing open presents, chewing up candles, and drooling on the Hanukkah gelt, and each night the family gets a little mad and then forgives him. A new pet is a growing experience for both the family and the pup, and the narration focuses on Latke's gratitude for being taken in ('I am one lucky dog!'), even as he hopes not to lose the family's affection while learning to function in their home. He is adorable, fluffy, and expressive, and Beeke's sunny palette and childlike illustrative style keep things light. <strong>This is a pleasant Hanukkah title, with the bonus of nicely conveying that the rescued animal is a lucky dog indeed. A brief description of the holiday is included.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>Youngsters will root for the puppy</strong> who is adopted by a family as a Hanukkah present for their children. Hijinks ensue and the family is very tolerant as the young dog learns proper behavior. They name him Latke because his coloring is like a potato pancake. As the family lights each candle in the menorah, Latke seems to get into a jam. There is a note at the back of the book explaining the holiday of Hanukkah and unfamiliar terms. <strong>Child-like illustrations perfectly match the text.</strong> A cooking tie-in to the book would be appropriate. <strong>It is recommended for those libraries that need to round out their holiday book choices.</strong> [Editor's Note: Available in e-book format and paperback.] Recommended."&#x2015;<em>Library Media Connection</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Latke, a playful golden brown shelter dog with good intentions, comes to live with his new family on the first night of Hanukkah. However, he scoffs at the <em>sufganiyot</em> (jelly donuts), shreds the present wrappings, gobbles the latkes, gnaws on a dreidel, topples the applesauce, slobbers on the chocolate Hanukkah coins, and chomps the menorah candles into a sticky mess. Discouraged, the family begins to question their decision to adopt, until the final night of Hanukkah when they present him with his very own chew toy. Fischer's humorous story is narrated from Latke's perspective, effectively contrasting his well-meant exuberance with the family's growing distress. The kids are mostly understanding; Mom and Dad, not so much. Beeke's colorful artwork depicts everyone's efforts to do the right thing, while small touches (such as the candles in the menorah) convey holiday details. The story's secular tone will please less observant families.

As the family celebrates the Festival of Lights, Latke joins in, thinking, 'I am one lucky dog!' But he has a lot to learn about how to behave. This engaging romp follows Latke as he chews his way through the eight nights of Hanukkah. <strong>Told in Latke's voice, the story highlights the holiday's traditions as well as the love between the dog and his new family.

They either loved them or hated them; they were either proud to wear their uniform or refused to join. Whatever their feelings, most former Guides retain strong memories of their experiences.All too often regarded merely in terms of biscuit sales and sing-songs, hardly anybody is aware of the massive impact that the Guides had on gender equality and, more fundamentally, the outcome of the Second World War. In this eye-opening history, Janie Hampton explores how the Guides' work was crucial to Britain's victory. When the Blitz broke out, the Guides knew what to do. They kept up morale in bomb shelters, demonstrating 'blitz cooking' with emergency ovens made from the bricks of bombed houses at the request of the Ministry of Food. They grew food on their company allotments and knitted for the entire country. The embodiment of the Home Front spirit, they dug shelters, provided crucial First Aid, and also assisted the millions of children who were forced to flee their city homes to safer places in the country.It is difficult to imagine what the war effort would have looked like without the Guides.

Stunning artwork captures the lives of a variety of animals and bugs in their natural surroundings and the changes that occur as they endure the passage of time, from birth to adulthood, winter to autumn, and more.</p><p>Thomas Hegbrook is a nature lover with a talent for illustration and design. When he&#39;s not creating beautiful books, he likes to spend time with his wife and son and their two dogs.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Simple narratives about animals and nature unfold through artwork in this refreshingly open-ended work. The book begins with an invitation: "Every picture tells a story. What do you think that story is?" One hundred wordless illustrations are presented for children to examine, interpret, and discuss. From a snake shedding its skin to a baby koala climbing out of his mother's pouch and onto her back, the scenes celebrate the beauty and mystery of nature. Full-page spreads interspersed with vertical and horizontal panels add variety to this sturdy oversize volume. The rich, jewel-tone illustrations are large and bright, ideal for sharing with a group but intricate enough to encourage individual pondering. In the back, Hegbrook offers his own explanation for each scene alongside thumbnails of the illustrations, so readers can check their own interpretations against the author's intentions and learn more about the creatures represented. Overall, the book is conducive to building a sense of wonder and appreciation for nature, while encouraging the development of narrative and critical thinking skills.

Yet there have been relatively few attempts to understand the video game as an independent medium. Most such efforts focus on the earliest generation of text-based adventures (<i>Zork,</i> for example) and have little to say about such visually and conceptually sophisticated games as <i>Final Fantasy X, Shenmue, Grand Theft Auto, Halo, </i>and<i> The Sims,</i> in which players inhabit elaborately detailed worlds and manipulate digital avatars with a vast&#x2014;and in some cases, almost unlimited&#x2014;array of actions and choices. <br><br>In <i>Gaming</i>, Alexander Galloway instead considers the video game as a distinct cultural form that demands a new and unique interpretive framework. Drawing on a wide range of disciplines, particularly critical theory and media studies, he analyzes video games as something to be played rather than as texts to be read, and traces in five concise chapters how the &#x201c;algorithmic culture&#x201d; created by video games intersects with theories of visuality, realism, allegory, and the avant-garde. If photographs are images and films are moving images, then, Galloway asserts, video games are best defined as actions. <br><br>Using examples from more than fifty video games, Galloway constructs a classification system of action in video games, incorporating standard elements of gameplay as well as software crashes, network lags, and the use of cheats and game hacks. In subsequent chapters, he explores the overlap between the conventions of film and video games, the political and cultural implications of gaming practices, the visual environment of video games, and the status of games as an emerging cultural form. <br><br>Together, these essays offer a new conception of gaming and, more broadly, of electronic culture as a whole, one that celebrates and does not lament the qualities of the digital age. <br><br>Alexander R. Galloway is assistant professor of culture and communication at New York University and author of <i>Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization.</i></p><p>Alexander R.

She attended public schools and has lived in several of the city&#39;s distinctive neighborhoods, including Dickeyville, Tuscany-Canterbury, Evergreen, and South Federal Hill.Mystery fans should relish this taste of Baltimore's seamier side, the eighth volume in Akashic's series showcasing dark tales of crime and place (<i>Brooklyn Noir</i>, etc.). Editor Lippman offers both a fine introduction and the lead story ("Easy as A-B-C"), which is one of the anthology's best. Half of the 16 contributors have connections to the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, including David Simon of <i>Homicide</i> fame, whose "Stainless Steel" is a noir gem. Baltimore (aka "Bulletmore, Murderland") is a diverse city, and the stories reflect everything from its old row houses and suburban mansions to its beloved Orioles and harbor areas. There's dark humor in Dan Fesperman's "As Seen on TV," as well as in Tim Cockey's noir ghost story, "The Haunting of Slink Ridgely." Charlie Stella's mob story, "Ode to the O's," is brutally direct, while Ben Neihart's "Frog Cycle" offers a futuristic take on the high-tech industries springing up in place of factories.

Rushdie went to Nicaragua in 1986. What he discovered was overwhelming: a land of difficult, often beautiful contradictions, of strange heroes and warrior-poets. Rushdie came to know an enormous range of people, from the foreign minister - a priest - to the midwife who kept a pet cow in her living room. His perceptions always heightened by his sensitivity and his unique flair for language, in &#34;The Jaguar Smile&#34;, Rushdie brings us the true Nicaragua, where nothing is simple, everything is contested, and life-or-death struggles are an everyday occurrence.</p><p>Salman Rushdie is the author of ten novels, one collection of short stories, three works of non-fiction, and the co-editor of The Vintage Book of Indian Writing.

She came into the world on April 21, 1926, the equivalent of the modern Princess Beatrice, first-born daughter of the Duke of York, destined to flutter on the royal fringe. So while Lilibet was brought up with almost religious respect for the crown, there seemed no chance of her inheriting it.

Among the foods thought to encourage Lust, the love apple (now known as the tomato) was thought to possess demonic spirits until the nineteenth century. The Gluttony &#x201c;course&#x201d; invites the reader to an ancient Roman dinner party where nearly every dish served&#x2014;from poppy-crusted rodents to &#x201c;Trojan Pork&#x201d;&#x2014;was considered a crime against the state. While the vice known as Sloth introduces the sad story of &#x201c;The Lazy Root&#x201d; (the potato), whose popularity in Ireland led British moralists to claim that the Great Famine was God&#x2019;s way of punishing the Irish for eating a food that bred degeneracy and idleness.<br><br>Filled with incredible food history and the author&#x2019;s travels to many of these exotic locales, <i>In the Devil&#x2019;s Garden</i> also features recipes like the matzo-ball stews outlawed by the Spanish Inquisition and the forbidden &#x201c;chocolate champagnes&#x201d; of the Aztecs. This is truly a delectable book that will be consumed by food lovers, culinary historians, amateur anthropologists, and armchair travelers alike. <i>Bon app�tit!<br></i></p><p>Lust, gluttony, pride, sloth, greed, blasphemy, and anger--the seven deadly sins have all been linked to food. Matching the food to the sin, Stewart Lee Allen's <i>In the Devil's Garden: A Sinful History of Forbidden Foods</i> offers a high-spirited look at the way foods over time have been forbidden, even criminalized, for their "evil" effects. Food has often been, shockingly, morally weighted, from the tomato, originally called the love apple and thought to excite lust; to the potato, whose popularity in Ireland led British Protestants to associate it with sloth; to foods like corn or bread whose use was once believed to delineate "lowness," thus inflaming class pride. Allen's approach to this incredible history also includes tales of personal journeys to, for example, a Mount Athos monastery, where a monk reveals the sign of Satan in an apple, and to San Francisco to investigate dog eating. If his history is sometimes too glancing and facetious, even beyond the sensible need to entertain, it is always fascinating.<p> The book also features "forbidden" menus--such as the one devoted to gluttony that includes an entire steer stuffed with a whole lamb, stuffed with a pig, stuffed with a chicken, and served with sausages--and quite doable and delicious recipes, such as a dynamite hot and sweet banana ketchup and Lo Han Jai, a mushroom-replete vegetarian feast. But the real focus is on the human response to a primal pleasure--eating--and the way people have sought to control it, in every society and every culture, through prohibition. It's quite a tale. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><b>Stewart Lee Allen</b> is also author of <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee</i>, which was published in more than six countries.

We live in a golden age of astronomical observation. Some of the resulting images are well known and have inspired millions of people; others, equally breathtaking, have never been published before. For this book, Benson has culled the very best, and organized them into a thrilling journey through space and time to the universe's great places, ranging from "nearby" nebulae in our own Milky Way galaxy to the light of the Hubble Deep Field that has traveled billions of light-years. &nbsp; Every bit as innovative and beautiful as the author's successful <i>Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes </i>but far grander in conception, <i>Far Out </i>is an inspiring work of art and science on the cutting edge of human perception.<br><br> A Guide to the Cosmos, in Words and Images Dazzling and True �&#x2013;New York Times Book Review<br> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> [With Far Out] Take a good long look into space-time. &#x2013;Los Angeles Times<br> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> Far out by Michael Benson proves that putting the photographable universe into a book doesn&#x2019;t dampen its beauty. &#x2013; Men&#x2019;s Journal<br> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> An exquisite picture book of outer space. &#x2013;San Diego Union Tribune<br><p></p>&nbsp;&#x201c;<i>2001: A Space Odyssey </i>and <i>Far Out: A Space-Time Chronicle</i>: both are inspirational moving pictures. <i>Far Out </i>punches deep into space, like a series of jump cuts.

Journalist, filmmaker and photographer Benson follows his book <i>Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes</i> with an even more stellar array of astronomical photographs that offer glorious views of space, moving successively from close to home to the outermost regions of the universe, moving simultaneously farther from Earth and farther back in time. Benson's emphasis on the correlation between geological time and astronomical distance sets this book far apart from others. Light rays, he says, move like ripples in a pond... so vast that the ripples extending out from each event take thousands, millions, or even billions of years to echo off its banks. Light reaching Earth now from the Witch Head nebula, some 740 light-years distant, was generated in the 14th century. Elsewhere, remote galactic clusters, aggregate bonfires shining across the blackness of deep time, cast light as old as Pangaea, the Earth's ancient supercontinent, which broke up to create today's continents. Benson illuminates the vast scale of the universe and its workings with large-scale quasi-cinematic photos that reveal scintillating stars, galaxies and Rorschach-like nebulae in their true colors. The 228 color photos are spectacular and enhanced with three eight-page gatefolds. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

W. F. Hegel (1770&#x2013;1831), the influential German philosopher, believed that human history was advancing spiritually and morally according to God's purpose. At the beginning of Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Hegel writes: "What the history of Philosophy shows us is a succession of noble minds, a gallery of heroes of thought, who, by the power of Reason, have penetrated into the being of things, of nature and of spirit, into the Being of God, and have won for us by their labours the highest treasure, the treasure of reasoned knowledge."&nbsp;Volume 2 of Lectures on the History of Philosophy, titled Plato and the Platonists for this Bison Books edition, introduces the most renowned disciple of Socrates and the theory of Platonic forms before moving to Plato's disciple, Aristotle, whose advance to scientific thinking is carefully detailed. The subsequent increasing systematization and sophistication of philosophy leads to a discussion of the Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics. The first period in the history of philosophy comes to maturity with Plotinus in the third century B.C.</p><p>The development of philosophic science as science, and, further, the progress from the Socratic point of view to the scientific, begins with Plato and is completed by Aristotle. They of all others deserve to be called teachers of the human race."Hegel's <i>Geschichte der Philosophie</i> was one of the grand products of the renaissance in historical learning that took place in early nineteenth-century Germany. . . . Hegel remains relevant today for his recognition that any self-critical philosophy must include a knowledge of its own history. A self-aware philosopher, Hegel firmly believed, knew where his ideas came from and their social and cultural context. . . . This is still the only available translation of all three volumes of Hegel's history."&#x2014;Frederick C. Beiser, <i>The Fate of Reason: German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte</i> (Frederick C. Beiser)<br><br>"[Hegel] is, without doubt, the Aristotle of our post-Renaissance world."&#x2014;J. N. Findlay, <i>Hegel: A Re-examination</i> (J. N. Findlay)</p><h2>The Mystical Space of Carmel A Commentary on the Carmelite Rule (Fiery Arrow)</h2><p>Mount Carmel, viewed as a holy place by Jews, Christians and Muslims, is where the prophet Elijah is venerated. For many centuries hermits have followed his example and monks regard him as their Father. During the crusades, around 1200 A.D., a small group of hermits settled around the spring of Elijah to lead a contemplative life there in silence and solitude. To the first Carmelites this geographic location was a mystical space in which to live in the presence of God alone. Albert, patriarch of Jerusalem, gave them a life rule (1206-1214) which, at the time of their expulsion by the Saracens in 1247, was adapted to new circumstances by pope Innocent IV. In consequence, the mystical space of Carmel with its contemplative life is experienced wherever they are given a place and God calls them. The commentary presents the Carmel as a spiritual model which is ideally suited as accompaniment on the spiritual journey of all who know themselves called to a life in God&#39;s presence in the desert of their life. 1999)</p><p></p><h2>Hardline: The Hacker Series #3</h2><p>Software mogul Blake Landon has met his match in headstrong Erica Hathaway.

The fall of the former prefigures that of the latter. From the ruins of these mighty histories, Wark salvages ideas to help us picture what kind of worlds collective labor might yet build.

Beginning in 1955, Ashbery spent nearly a decade in France, working as an art critic in Paris and forming a relationship with the poet Pierre Martory. His translations of Martory's poems, featured here, were collected in <i>The Landscapist</i>, a Poetry Book Society Recommended Translation in 2008 and a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in poetry.</p><p>In this volume, Ashbery presents a wide selection of France's finest poets: Charles Baudelaire, St�phane Mallarm�, Arthur Rimbaud, Max Jacob, Pierre Reverdy, Paul �luard, and its greatest living poet, Yves Bonnefoy. A rich array of 171 poems by twenty-four poets, this bilingual volume also features a selection from Ashbery's masterly translation of Rimbaud's <i>Illuminations</i>. The development of modern French poetry emerges through Ashbery's chronology, as does the depth of French influences on his iconoclastic career and the poets of the New York School. Collected together for the first time, Ashbery's translations represent decades of remarkable work from the writer hailed by Harold Bloom as a part of the "American sequence that includes Whitman, Dickinson, Stevens, and Hart Crane."</p></p><p><p><b>John Ashbery</b>'s latest book of poems is <i>Quick Question</i>.

One of the first to venture into the realm of psychological warfare, Ellis Zacharias was awarded the Legion of Merit with two gold stars for his contributions. Among the highlights of his impressive career was the role he played in convincing the Japanese to accept surrender in 1945, a subject he deals with in fascinating detail in this book. <br><p>Zacharias gives readers access to rare psychological profiles that he prepared for the Office of Naval Intelligence on leading political and military figures in Japan. His book also recounts his exploits as a young naval attach� with the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo in the early 1920s. In the early months of the war readers join him in the thick of combat in the Pacific, first aboard a cruiser under his command and later in a battleship. Of particular interest are descriptions of his one-man radio broadcasts beamed at Japan between V-E and V-J days that received kudos from Adm. Ernest J. King for helping bring about the surrender.</p></p><p>Ellis M. Zacharias was a rear admiral and naval attach� to Japan who served in World War I and World War II. After World War II, he was appointed as the deputy director of US Naval Intelligence, and post-retirement he narrated the NBC television docudrama series <i>Behind Closed Doors.</i> He died in 1961."One of the classics of naval intelligence." -- <i>Naval Intelligence Professionals Quarterly, Summer 2003</i></p><h2>Twisted Blade in the Arena (Boys of Imperial Rome, 4)</h2><p>The Roman Empire, AD 108: Rich and poor alike revel in the bloody thrills of gladiatorial combat staged in arenas across the empire.

Zack attended the London Film School, supporting himself as a comic-strip illustrator and later plunged into gay art and publishing. Innumerable illustrations poured from his pen and brush for British magazines &#x201c;HIM International,&#x201d; &#x201c;Vulcan,&#x201d; &#x201c;Teenage Dreams,&#x201d; the &#x201c;HIM Gay Library&#x201d; series, and &#x201c;Mister&#x201d; magazine. For HIM he created the mold-breaking Rogue comic strip and later &#x201c;The Street,&#x201d; which was part of the inspiration behind cult TV series &#x201c;Queer As Folk.&#x201d; The Internet has spread his reputation to an enormous global fan base through many sites and blogs.

Britannicus saw nothing of the other&#x2019;s hooded features, a mere shade within the dark corridors of the amphitheater&#x2019;s underworks. Above their heads, through heavy masonry, came the muted roar of spectators hungry for blood. It sounded as if all of Capua was up there on the stone benches. The instructions Britannicus had received the day before assured the slave of the benefits of the phial&#x2019;s contents to his master: an additive that would give the gladiator even more stamina and help ensure victory in the arena.<br>He went smartly past the cramped and noisy arming chamber where the lesser gladiators were crammed together. As their coarse banter faded, he reached the cubicles set aside for champions, more private spaces for the most celebrated fighters where they could prepare for combat in seclusion. Britannicus offered a cup of wine.<br>The traditional gesture touched his master. He sniffed appreciatively. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how you do it, but this is a fine Caecuban. Thank you, Britannicus.&#x201d; He quaffed the draught in one gulp. Britannicus took the cup from him and helped to fit and adjust his manica. The arm guard extended to the shoulder and left side of the gladiator&#x2019;s chest. Then he fitted the galerus, a metal shoulder shield to protect the neck and chin from an upswinging gladius. <br>&#x201c;Thank you. I will need it today, facing one of the secutores. Not, I hope, that Scythian bastard Bebryx.&#x201d; He smiled warmly at the Briton, at the way the boy&#x2019;s flaxen hair fell into oh-so grave eyes. They were well-matched opposites: the slave so white, the gladiator so black. &#x201c;I shall be back for you before the sand is half-run through the glass.&#x201d; And with those words Capreolus swept out into the arena to the roar of the Capuan crowd.<br>Britannicus smiled to himself as the mob&#x2019;s noise settled into an expectant hush. He held the cup aloft, turned it upside down and let the remaining drops of dark wine fall to the stone floor. In the dust they looked like drops of blood. He scuffed them out. Beyond the walls, the clash of iron rang out.<br>Still smiling, he lowered his arms and took the cup to the basin to wash it out carefully. Capreolus was a tremendous fighter, but a performance-boost couldn&#x2019;t hurt, and the man who had persuaded Britannicus of the potion&#x2019;s efficacy said that in offering it he was only protecting an investment. But Capreolus was too honest for his own good, in Britannicus&#x2019;s opinion, so he didn&#x2019;t want to risk his master finding anything suspicious in an unwashed cup, otherwise he&#x2019;d go straight to the authorities and declare the fight unfair. And Britannicus certainly didn&#x2019;t want a nosy referee discovering that he had put something in the champion&#x2019;s wine to give him the promised advantage over his opponent.<br>* * *<br>For a moment it seemed the ground must cave in with the thumping and crashing as Capreolus, the huge Nubian retiarius, leaped around Bebryx&#x2019;s helmeted head. Bebryx thrashed this way and that in an attempt to avoid lethal blows from the cruel trident. As a secutor he was thankful for the helmet with its face covering which protected him from the trident&#x2019;s prongs, but in rapid action its two eyeholes often made it hard to see where his opponent was. He whirled, acquired target again, watched and waited for an opportunity to turn the tables on the black man. They clashed in a blur of flying limbs, half-deafened by the ringing of iron, and a fine haze of crimson droplets from nicks and open wounds.<br>As a giant beast baying for blood, the roars of the spectators rose to the heavens above Capua from Italy&#x2019;s second largest amphitheater. Bebryx flicked away sweat from his eyes with a vigorous shake of his head inside the confines of the helmet and readied himself for the next predictable move. He knew his adversary&#x2019;s style and fighting rhythm. And it came. Capreolus delivered three blows so rapid they would have killed a novice in the blink of an eye, but Bebryx was an adept and three-time champion adored by all of Capua.<br>Nevertheless, he only managed to avoid the last strike of the wicked tines by jinking violently sideways and throwing himself to the bloodied sand to roll over and over. All around the merciless gore-soaked theater of death his name sounded from a score thousand lips. For three years he had survived and prospered in a career that averaged ten months for even the most agile youngster. Yet it seemed Capreolus was learning new tricks from his lanista&#x2019;s trainer for in the next breathless moments the Nubian twice did the opposite of what Bebryx had expected and followed up ferociously on the advantage it gained him.<br>This last strike left Bebryx eating bloody grit on the floor of the arena again, desperately struggling to avoid the retiarius&#x2019;s trident or becoming entangled in his infernal fisherman&#x2019;s net. Looking up, he caught a glimpse of his adversary&#x2019;s balls and cock, tightly compressed like a black snake about to spring from the narrow confines of the inadequate pouch.<br>Capua was honored for its provincial celebration of the Ludi Romani festival by the presence of Consul Quintus Pompeius Falco to represent the absent Imperator Caesar Marcus Ulpius Nerva Traianus Augustus. Falco had decreed a primus exhibition&#x2015;a bitter fight to the death. Bebryx had no intention of paying the ferryman yet&#x2015;and one of them had to die&#x2015;so it would be Capreolus the Nubian who would not be keeping his beautiful blond British boy warm tonight. The Nubian stabbed at him again, and again Bebryx dodged by rolling aside. On the fourth occasion, however, for just the blink of an eye, Capreolus lost balance. He seemed to falter and let his net trail as if he had lost the use of that arm. He recovered sufficiently to move his feet and ready another stabbing blow. Bebryx easily avoided the surprisingly clumsy maneuver. Capreolus staggered as he thrust a second time, but his aim went wide and he buried the points of his trident deep in the red-streaked sand.<br>Bebryx reached out, grasped a handful of gore, and in the flash of a lizard&#x2019;s tail hurled it into his opponent&#x2019;s face. The sand, made glutinous with blood, clung and blinded. Shouting with rage, the huge fellow lashed out about him. Bebryx rose easily to his feet as the crowd roared its approval. The Nubian in his blinded state had trodden on his own net. Faster than a striking snake Bebryx wrapped it around Capreolus&#x2019;s legs and pulled. The enraged fighter crashed to the arena floor in a welter of ebony limbs.<br>Adoring women in the crowd screamed and gasped their excitement as Bebryx snatched up the trident and, reversing it, placed its razor-sharp tines at the throat of its owner. Capreolus cleared the sand from his eyes and glared up balefully at Bebryx.<br>&#x201c;Kill!&#x201d; roared the crowd as one. &#x201c;Kill! Kill!&#x201d;<br>Bebryx looked up at the imperial box, where the distant figure of the city&#x2019;s chief magistrate consulted Pompeius Falco.<br>&#x201c;Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!&#x201d;<br>The consul stood up to gesture the deathblow. Bebryx leaned his full hefty weight on the end of the trident and felt it pierce the black flesh. The razor-sharp points bored through skin, muscle, and bone as a fountain of blood blossomed from the major vessels torn apart by the thrust to end another life.<br>High in the amphitheater&#x2019;s stands money exchanged hands, a thousand times more than Britannicus had received in the belief he was helping his lover and master to victory. Blood money for bets laid in the certainty of the winner, in the certainty of a planned-for loser. Fortuna was all very well in the arena, but she wasn&#x2019;t a guarantee&#x2015;that required a human touch to ensure a happy outcome.<br>Blithely unaware that the fight had been a fraud, though puzzled at his opponent&#x2019;s uncharacteristic sudden clumsiness, Bebryx watched as three attendants dragged the lifeless corpse away to the Porta Libitinensis&#x2015;Libitina&#x2019;s gate, where the death goddess welcomed fallen gladiators through her one-way portal&#x2015;with their meat hooks attached in Capreolus&#x2019;s ruined neck. Garlands and purses full of money landed about Bebryx&#x2019;s feet. Grateful gamblers usually threw in a portion of their winnings in tribute. As Bebryx finished saluting the imperial box and his adoring fans&#x2015;all those salivating matrons&#x2015;he considered with anticipation taking over Capreolus&#x2019;s lovely slave. Britannicus would make a fine gift to himself and otherwise the poor boy would be so lonely without his big Nubian to cuddle him in the increasingly chilly autumn nights.</p><h2>Native North American Spirituality of the Eastern Woodlands: Sacred Myths, Dreams, Visions, Speeches, Healing Formulas, Rituals and Ceremonials (Classics of Western Spirituality)</h2><p>The most in-depth and scholarly panorama of Western spirituality ever attempted!<p>In one series, the original writings of the universally acknowledged teachers of the Catholic, Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish, Islamic and Native American traditions have been critically selected, translated and introduced by internationally recognized scholars and spiritual leaders.</p><p>The texts are first-rate, and the introductions are informative and reliable.

The emergence of a globalized network of film festivals has enabled these young directors to make and circulate films that are changing the aesthetics and politics of art house cinema and challenging feminist genealogies.

Visit him online at gilbertford.com.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Levy (We Shall Overcome: The Story of a Song) once again combines music and history, this time penning a sophisticated picture book that presents a moment in the Civil War through the framework of soldiers' songs. An introductory note places students within the context of the Civil War, but the bulk of the story revolves around the Battle of Fredericksburg. While stuck at an impasse on opposite sides of a river after an unexpected Rebel victory, recovering soldiers marked their days with musical military rituals and spent their nights trading opposing patriotic songs that they "fired back and forth like musical cannonballs." This engaging and descriptive narrative is interspersed with first-person soldiers' accounts. The culmination of the tale is when one side began to play "Home Sweet Home" and the other side joined in, resulting in a night of mutual celebration. Through this event, soldiers were revealed to one another, and thus to readers, as entirely human; "the enemy was also a son, a brother, a husband," to the point where the song was forbidden. Ford (The Wonderful Thing That Came from a Spring) illustrates this heartfelt account with deep colors and silhouetted cutouts. The warmth and explosiveness of music are represented by swirling orange and red lines, along with the actual notations of many of the songs. Ford does not shy away from the brutality of war but avoids gruesomeness with the muted palette and stylized art. The unifying point in time is depicted in a wordless moonlit spread, with layered shades of purple, blue, and green. Concluding with extensive back matter, Levy and Ford leave readers satisfied.

Julie Delporte examines cultural artifacts and sometimes traumatic memories through the lens of the woman she is today&#x2015;a feminist who understands the reality of the women around her, how experiencing rape culture and sexual abuse is almost synonymous with being a woman, and the struggle of reconciling one&#x2019;s feminist beliefs with the desire to be loved.

She structures these moments in a nonlinear fashion, presenting each one as a snapshot of a place and time&#x2015;trips abroad, the moment you realize a relationship is over, and a traumatizing childhood event of sexual abuse that haunts her to this day. While <i>This Woman&#x2019;s Work</i> is deeply personal, it is also a reflection of the conversations that women have with themselves when trying to carve out their feminist identity.

Thatamanil compares their diagnoses and prognoses of the human predicament in light of their doctrine of God or Ultimate Reality. What emerges is a new theology of God and human beings, with a richer and more radical conception of divine immanence, a reconceived divine transcendence, and a keener sense of how the dynamic and active Spirit at work in us anchors real hope and deep joy. Using key insights from Christian and Hindu thought Thatamanil vindicates comparative theology, expands the vocabulary about the ineffable God, and arrives at a new construal of the problems and prospects of the human condition.</p><p>John J.

But as the miles slipped beneath the tyres of their big BMWs, their troubles started. Exhaustion, injury and accidents tested their strength. Treacherous roads, unpredictable weather and turbulent politics challenged their stamina. They were chased by paparazzi in Kazakhstan, courted by men with very large guns in the Ukraine, hassled by the police, and given bulls&#39; testicles for supper by Mongolian nomads. And yet despite all these obstacles they managed to ride more than twenty thousand miles in four months, changing their lives forever in the process. As they travelled they documented their trip, taking photographs, and writing diaries by the campfire.

In this evocative cookbook, the "Wick," as it is affectionately known, welcomes you into the warmth to share the celebrated cuisine of Inn's The Pointe Restaurant. Since the Wick first opened in 1996, it has been regarded for its rustic elegance, warm hospitality, and incredible west coast cuisine. This cookbook highlights the innovative dishes (and the stories behind them) that have made The Pointe a destination dining experience like no other, and paints a vivid picture of spectacular natural surroundings, west coast life, and scenic ocean-to-table dining. <br>Memorable recipes from the Wick are coupled with signature recipes from current and former chefs--Warren Barr, Rod Butters, Matthias Conradi, Mark Filatow, Justin Laboissiere, Duncan Ly, Andrew Springett, and Matt Wilson--and combine cutting edge techniques with fresh, seasonal ingredients, to create a distinctly contemporary, west coast cookbook. Inside you will find both sophisticated and accessible recipes that speak to the Inn's longstanding commitment to farm- and ocean-fresh ingredients, and strike a harmonious balance between the bounties of land and sea that surround the Inn. The Wickaninnish Cookbook offers a chance to visit life on nature's edge, and discover dishes from one of the most prestigious kitchens in Canada.</p><p>THE WICKANINNISH INN, Tofino, Canada, is a landmark Relais &amp; Ch�teaux designated hotel--an enchanting and acclaimed getaway perched on the western edge of Vancouver Island in beautiful British Columbia. Established in 1996, The Wickaninnish Inn is the only resort on beautiful Chesterman Beach and is a luxury destination for foodies and island visitors alike.<br><br>Honoured as a member of <i>Travel + Leisure</i>'s Hall of Fame and <i>Cond� Nast Traveler</i>'s Platinum Circle<b>Introduction</b><br><br>THERE&#x2019;S A MOMENT, when you&#x2019;re driving along Highway 4, after you&#x2019;ve passed the stands of towering old-growth Douglas firs of Cathedral Grove and traversed the narrow switchbacks near Kennedy Lake, when you turn a corner, top a rise, and there it is: your first glimpse of the wild west coast of Vancouver Island. A froth of whitewater rolls onto the wide, sandy strand of Long Beach, where the Pacific Ocean stretches out to meet the horizon.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve seen this view countless times, and it&#x2019;s nothing short of magical. But for me, it means one thing above all: home.<br><br>Just a few minutes farther up the road is the Wickaninnish Inn, the realization of our long-held family dream. Growing up along this wild coast, my parents would talk about opening an inn on the rocks overlooking Chesterman Beach. Our goal was to create a destination that would allow others to discover the remarkable beauty of this part of the world. To have our guests be mesmerized by the rolling waves, meet the fascinating characters we call our neighbours, and revel in the taste of local salmon and crab. We wanted to create a place of quiet serenity right on nature&#x2019;s edge.<br><br>&#x201c;The Wick,&#x201d; as our friends like to call it, has become that place. Today we are a 75-room inn perched on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, with a view of this mighty ocean from every room, suite, and public space. The Inn was the first high-end hotel on the west coast of Vancouver Island and the first destination resort, with all that implies: high-thread-count sheets, attentive service, and a soothing ambience of natural wood, stone, and glass combined with the soft colours of the rainforest. We&#x2019;re honoured to be a member of the Relais &amp; Ch�teaux family, an international association of intimately scaled luxury properties guided by the five Cs: Calm, Character, Courtesy, Charm, and&#x2014;perhaps most importantly&#x2014;Cuisine.<br><br>The Pointe Restaurant is the crown jewel of the Wickaninnish Inn. The space is encircled with floor-to-ceiling windows framing a 240-degree panorama of Chesterman Beach, forested offshore islands, and the endless ocean. Inspired by our family cabin on the adjacent point of land, at first glance, the room looks simple: an octagonal space with wooden chairs and tables protected by massive hand-adzed cedar posts and beams fanning out from a central core to the windows and ever-changing vistas beyond. Look closer, though, and you&#x2019;ll see the quiet handcrafted elegance of expertly detailed woodwork and perfectly placed lighting illuminating locally crafted tableware and haunting works by local First Nations artists. We&#x2019;ve done all we can to create everything with care, no detail left to chance.<br><br>But as spectacular as the scenery is, and as elegant as the d�cor is, the real masterpieces here are on the plates. <br><br>Since opening in 1996, our kitchen has been led by some of Canada&#x2019;s most talented chefs, from our opening chef, Chef Rod Butters, to current Executive Chef Warren Barr. Not only have they prepared delicious meals for our guests, they have also been leaders in the sustainable, seasonal, farm-to-table&#x2014;or more accurately on this coast, boat-to-table&#x2014;culinary movement. Long before it was fashionable, they were sourcing produce from the Island&#x2019;s fishers, foragers, and farmers. Through their menus, they celebrated the incredible local seafood bounty, including Dungeness crab, salmon, spot prawns, and halibut, as well as treasures of the forest, such as tender chanterelle mushrooms and tart cynamoka berries. They created a style of cuisine unique to this region; they also inspired other chefs who over time have transformed tiny Tofino into one of Canada&#x2019;s great culinary communities.<br><br>In the following pages, we&#x2019;ve gathered some of the most unforgettable dishes created by our chefs, including Chef Butters&#x2019;s shellfish-rich potlatch, a West Coast take on bouillabaisse (page 126); Chef Duncan Ly&#x2019;s Thai-scented chowder (page 60); Chef Andrew Springett&#x2019;s cinnamon-scented duck (page 168); Chef Mark Filatow&#x2019;s bright sidestripe prawn escabeche (page 148); Chef Justin Labossiere&#x2019;s saffron-scented ravioli stuffed with crab (page 144); Executive Chef Barr&#x2019;s crispy briny oyster coals (page 130) and his beautifully sculpted salmon mosaic (page 132); Chef Matthias Conradi&#x2019;s decadent chocolate platter for two (page 199); and Chef Matt Wilson&#x2019;s hearty sourdough bread (page 71). There is salmon in a myriad of dishes, crab in almost as many, and chowder, so much chowder. <br><br>Are you hungry yet? Well, you&#x2019;re in luck&#x2014;all the deliciousness of the Wickaninnish Inn lies just ahead.

And, having learned well from their long-dead masters, they&#x2019;ve established a hierarchical society&#x2014;one with humanoid aristo rulers at the top and slave-chipped workers at the bottom, performing the lowly tasks all androids were originally created to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Designed as a concubine for a species that hasn&#x2019;t existed for two hundred years, femmebot Freya Nakamichi-47&#x2014;one of the last of her kind still functioning&#x2014;accepts a job from a stranger to deliver a package from mercury to Mars.

He holds degrees in pharmacy and computer science, and has worked in a variety of jobs including pharmacist, technical author, software engineer, and freelance journalist. He is now a full-time writer.In the preamble to his latest far-reaching novel, Stross invokes Asimov&#x2019;s famous three laws of robotics, including the one that says robots are forbidden to harm their human masters. The problem here is that there are no more humans left to harm; they became extinct sometime in the twenty-third century. Hundreds of years on, the civilization that spans the solar system and beyond consists entirely of sophisticated androids, one of whom (the narrator) is struggling to make ends meet. With her usual patrons long dead, femmebot Freya Nakamichi must pick up work wherever she finds it. When a run-in with a vengeful android aristocrat forces her to flee a Venus resort, she grabs the first gig available: ferrying a mysterious package between Mercury and Mars. Unfortunately, many dangerous and powerful androids are also eager to pilfer the package, and the price of securing it may be Freya&#x2019;s own identity. Stross takes a plot device common to mystery novels and turns it into one of the most stylishly imaginative robot tales ever penned. --Carl Hays</p><h2>Cult and Controversy: The Worship of the Eucharist Outside Mass (Studies in the Reformed Rites of the Catholic Church, Vol 4)</h2><p>In the first part of this book, Father Mitchell traces the evolution within the Roman Catholic tradition of the cult of the Eucharist outside Mass, a change from holy meal to ritual drama that implied significant alterations of content, meaning, and interpretation.The second section comments on the mandates of Vatican Council II whose call to a return to proper praxis necessitated changes in then current pastoral practice and theological interpretation.</p><p>Nathan D.

Many of Herder&#39;s questions and concerns are more pressing at the end of the modern era than they were at its inception. Bunge&#39;s lucid and engaging translations of signal texts from Herder - most appearing here for the first time in English - are arranged thematically: human nature, language, and history; myth and religion; God and nature; literature and the Bible; and Christianity and theology. Along with her extensive Introduction and Bibliography, they constitute an essential resource for coming to terms with the checkered legacy of the Enlightenment.</p><p>Gregory Moore is lecturer in German at the University of St. Andrews.

This vivid portrayal of the early years of the war begins several months before the first shots were fired on Fort Sumter in April 1861. "The Philistines are upon us," twenty-year-old Josie writes in her diary, leaving no question about the alarm she feels when Confederate soldiers occupy her once-peaceful town. Offering a unique perspective on the tensions between the Union and the Confederacy, Josie reveals that Kentucky was a hotbed of political and military action, particularly in her hometown of Bowling Green, known as the Gibraltar of the Confederacy. Located along important rail and water routes that were vital for shipping supplies in and out of the Confederacy, the city linked the upper South's trade and population centers and was strategically critical to both armies. Capturing the fright and frustration she and her family experienced when Bowling Green served as the Confederate army's headquarters in the fall of 1861, Josie tells of soldiers who trampled fields, pilfered crops, burned fences, cut down trees, stole food, and invaded homes and businesses. In early 1862, Josie's outspoken Unionist father, Warner Underwood, was ordered to evacuate the family's Mount Air estate, which was later destroyed by occupying forces. Wartime hardships also strained relationships among Josie's family, neighbors, and friends, whose passionate beliefs about Lincoln, slavery, and Kentucky's secession divided them. Published for the first time, Josie Underwood's Civil War Diary interweaves firsthand descriptions of the political unrest of the day with detailed accounts of an active social life filled with travel, parties, and suitors. Bringing to life a Unionist, slave-owning young woman who opposed both Lincoln's policies and Kentucky's secession, the diary dramatically chronicles the physical and emotional traumas visited on Josie's family, community, and state during wartime.</p><p>Nancy Disher Baird is the author of Healing Kentucky: Medicine in the Bluegrass State and coauthor of Western Kentucky University: The First 100 Years.

Driving through L.A.'s side streets, following leads, tailing suspects-it all appeals to Song's romantic ideal of the noir hero. But when she's knocked out while investigating a mysterious car and finds a body in her own trunk, Song lurches back to the real L.A., becoming embroiled in a crime that goes far beyond role play. What's more, this isn't the first time Song has stuck her nose in other people's business.

The Marlowe featured a fleur-de-lis floating in the valley of an M as its logo, and fleur-de-lis peppered every plausible surface of the place, from the spikes on the gate to the hallway walls and elevator doors. I rode up to the third floor and found Luke&#x2019;s apartment tucked in a corner behind a black door with three squares staggered in white geometric outlines from top to bottom. <br>A printout taped to the door commanded in bold black font: COME ON IN AND LOSE THE SHOES. I turned the knob and laughter and hip-hop spilled out at the first crack in the doorway, the pulse of the subwoofer smacking my ribs with a little less force than cardiac arrest. <br>A landfill of footwear clogged the entrance&#x2014;flip-flops, Birkenstocks, loafers brown and black, Nikes and Converse, floral printed espadrilles, round-toed ballet flats in twelve colors. I looked down at my glossy pin-thin heels and scoured the floor for a friend. A wadded yellow sock peered at me from an unlaced sneaker, and as I started to surrender, I saw the pair that made mine look like Sunday shoes. They were tall, pointy, and painted in glitter, with bloodred soles and scarce worn in-soles reading CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTIN. <br>She was about as hard to spot as a clown in a prison cafeteria, wearing just a shade less makeup, tarred and sequined in steel gray from bust to midthigh, earlobes hoisting oversize Eiffel Tower chandeliers. She clocked in at about five foot one on a tall day, and except for some heavily jeweled wrists, she would have been easy enough to smuggle in carry-on luggage. Her left hand held the conic bowl of a martini glass in a loose circle between thumb and forefinger, and her right hand gripped the sleeve of Luke&#x2019;s button-down midbicep. Her long, dark eyes squinted as her wide red mouth gaped with silver laughter. Loose curls dyed a toasted honey brown fell past her shoulders, ends trembling on a modest bosom. She crinkled a nose that could hide behind a penny. One crooked incisor poked just a couple millimeters ahead of her front teeth&#x2014;this would be her moneymaker, the Cheshire detail, the bite mark in your memory. <br>He looked like a giant next to the girl. He had always been tall&#x2014;when I met him he was six foot two and 140 pounds. Sometime in college, he had filled out and grown into impressive good looks, with soft toffee-brown hair, an unearned surfer&#x2019;s tan, and kind eyes the mellow green of new sage. He wore dark jeans and a gray dress shirt with a thread count higher than most people&#x2019;s sheets. Luke, like many of his classmates at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, had an indulging father with deep pockets, and, though he didn&#x2019;t like to admit it, expensive taste. <br>Luke and I had been friends since high school, though back then we spent little time together off campus. We were both good students, and we developed a comfortable rapport over a series of shared classes, without getting to know each other particularly well. In December of our senior year, we were both admitted early to Yale, and we started to hang out and become friends. By a stroke of fate, we were placed in the same residential college our freshman year, and soon after that, I fell in love with his roommate. Except for a brief hiccup after Diego and I broke up, the three of us went through college like peas in a pod. <br>After my freshman year, my family left Los Angeles for Houston. No one expected me to settle down in Texas, and after graduation I moved back to my hometown. When I did, Luke was the reason I still felt at home. I did most of my moviegoing, grocery shopping, and eating out with him. He spent the year after graduation contemplating life goals, then ended up in film school with an aspiration to produce documentaries with deep, important social messages. He was a fitting companion for a private tutor without higher ambitions. Most weeks I worked twenty hours for an hourly rate high enough to keep me afloat. We both had plenty of free time and lacked the credentials to judge each other, and two consecutive days without contact was a strange and infrequent occurrence. <br>Luke cupped his hand and curled his fingers to call me over. I was his exact height in five-inch heels and enjoyed standing shoulder to shoulder, but I obeyed the sign before stepping over to Luke and the girl. <br>&#x201c;Song! Thank God you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d; <br>I raised an eyebrow and looked at the girl enjoying his company. &#x201c;Are you in need of rescue?&#x201d; <br>He glanced at her and shook his head with a guilty smirk. &#x201c;Just happy to see you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Likewise, then. The place is really coming together.&#x201d; When I had visited on Wednesday, there had been nowhere to sit. <br>&#x201c;Like it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, you did let me pick the couch. And you know how much I love Philip Marlowe.&#x201d; <br>He smiled. &#x201c;So much that no flesh-and-blood man can compete.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;With witty brooding Philip Marlowe? Of course not.&#x201d; I gave him a light punch on the shoulder. Luke was also between relationships, but my perpetual singledom was still a favorite topic. <br>He remembered the girl on his arm and introduced us. &#x201c;Sorry, Song, this is Lori Lim. Lori, Juniper Song. But everyone calls her Song. I guess you can understand why.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, shush, my parents were immigrants. Not all of us get to have names that wear sweater-vests, Lucas William Cook.&#x201d; I turned to Lori and put out a hand and a &#x201c;good to meet you&#x201d; with my best meeting smile. <br>She slid her tongue over the jutting corner of her jagged tooth and clamped it lightly in a lazy smile. Her dark eyes were sugar-glazed and sleepy, glitter lids fluttering and drooping. A lightweight. She took my hand in two dainty paws and planted a kiss, staining it with sparkling, plum-tinted lip gloss. Her glass pushed against her cheek and a few drops of clear liquid spilled onto the floor. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re tall, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; She looked at me, pupils hidden coyly behind a wall of mascaraed lashes. <br>&#x201c;Can you tell she&#x2019;s a little drunk?&#x201d; Luke yelled in whisper-tones. &#x201c;Did you Korean girls get together and decide this was a cocktail party, by the way?&#x201d; <br>After a four-second delay, Lori bent over dripping with laughter and socked Luke in the shoulder. <br>I watched her and smiled. &#x201c;I guess I didn&#x2019;t realize we were still nineteen. When do we start taking body shots?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you hilarious.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kidding. Congrats on the new place. I did overdress, but in my defense it&#x2019;s been a while since I&#x2019;ve been out among non-you people. So I decided to pull out the stops for this thing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, you look good. I&#x2019;ll buy you a drink from my fridge.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thanks. I&#x2019;ll take a beer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in a second.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hold it.&#x201d; I pointed at the petite lush and mouthed, <i>What do I do with this?</i> She was humming now. <br>Luke turned and twisted his mouth. &#x201c;Give her a boy to play with, she&#x2019;ll know what to do.&#x201d; <br>I turned to Lori. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back. Want anything?&#x201d; <br>She squinted her eyes and gave me a dreamy pouty smile and a belabored shake of the head. I followed Luke to the kitchen. <br>&#x201c;Hostile, much? She&#x2019;s drunk, not insensate. Who is she anyway?&#x201d; <br>He opened the refrigerator and looked thoughtfully at the beer supply. &#x201c;She works for my dad&#x2019;s firm. Some kind of secretary or paralegal or who the fuck knows.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can tell you&#x2019;re a fan.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m oozing with adoration. This is me oozing.&#x201d; He tilted his head down at me and gave me his best impression of a jaded student in a lecture on fractals. <br>&#x201c;She is adorable. She&#x2019;s a my-size Barbie with an A-cup. I kind of want to take her home and have her look pretty on my couch. Can she even talk, or is that Joker mouth for show?&#x201d; <br>He pulled two cold beers from the fridge and snapped off the caps. They hissed and smoked deliciously. <br>&#x201c;Oh, definitely not for show.&#x201d; He chuckled and took a sip of his beer. &#x201c;Actually, I have to talk to you about something.&#x201d; <br>I was about to take a swig but brought the bottle back down. &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; <br>He furrowed his brows and his eyes were long triangles as he pointed at Lori with his chin. &#x201c;I need to find out if she&#x2019;s banging my dad.&#x201d; I started to laugh but inhaled it. Staring back at me were two pools of green sobriety. &#x201c;Seriously, Song, I think she&#x2019;s sleeping with him.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Luke didn&#x2019;t make a habit of second-guessing his father. He was an only child, and he grew up with an admiration of the elder Cook that bordered on worship.

The time is the early 1970s when the two giants were poised on the brink of war. And the characters in this thrilling collection of stories are Chinese soldiers who must constantly scrutinize the enemy even as they themselves are watched for signs of the fatal disease of bourgeois liberalism.<br><br>In <b>Ocean of Words</b>, the Chinese writer Ha Jin explores the predicament of these simple, barely literate men with breathtaking concision and humanity. From amorous telegraphers to a pugnacious militiaman, from an inscrutable Russian prisoner to an effeminate but enthusiastic recruit, Ha Jin's characters possess a depth and liveliness that suggest Isaac Babel's Cossacks and Tim O'Brien's GIs. <b>Ocean of Words</b> is a triumphant volume, poignant, hilarious, and harrowing.<br><br>"A compelling collection of stories, powerful in their unity of theme and rich in their diversity of styles."--New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Extraordinary...[These stories are shot through with wit and offer glimpses of human motivation that defy retelling...Read them all."--Boston Globe<br><br>"An exceptional new talent, capable of wringing rich surprises out of austere materials."--Portland Oregonian</p><p>Set on China's bleak northern border in the 1970s, when Russia and China were close to war, these short stories describe the life of soldiers, professional officers, and raw recruits, living in constant proximity. In this hierarchical and politically charged world, there is even less privacy than normal in China, highlighting a fundamental difference between Chinese and Western societies. The book provides an unusually brilliant insight into the Chinese psyche, with its preoccupations with food, family, and political standing, and its ambivalent attitudes toward women and animals. <p> Yet <i>Ocean of Words</i> also makes us aware of the common humanity that we share with Ha Jin's characters. Hunger, fear, sexual embarrassment, curiosity about the outside world are universal emotions, and we find ourselves caring deeply about these men. The title refers to a treasured dictionary in a story that brings together a maladjusted young man and an elderly officer. Ha Jin obviously cares deeply about words; his writing is spare, penetrating, and often funny, as when he describes the embarrassment of the officers at the "politically incorrect" earthiness of an old survivor of the Long March, who by definition must be considered an archetypal revolutionary. In this book, Ha Jin has done for the Chinese army what Zhang Xianliang did so powerfully for the prison camp in works like <i>Grass Soup</i>. <i>-- John Stevenson</i></p>"Extraordinary....

If anyone could produce a hybrid of Charlie Chaplin's playful "Little Tramp" and Charlize Theron's fierce "Imperator Furiosa," it would be Armantrout. Her language is unexpected yet exact, playing off the collective sense that the shifting ground of daily reality may be a warning of imminent systemic collapse. While there are glimmers here of what remains of "the natural world," the poet confesses the human failings, personal and societal, that have led to its devastation. No one's senses are more acutely attuned than Armantrout's, which makes her an exceptional observer and reporter of our faults. She leaves us wondering if the American Dream may be a nightmare from which we can't awaken.

He resides in Rhinebeck, New York.<br>Gr 6 Up&#x2014;This guide to mythology is everything the title promises and more. After an introduction setting out the book's goals and an initial chapter outlining a working definition of mythology, Leeming delves into the mythological traditions across the world (which include African, Asian, Polynesian, Cletiv, Greek, Roman, and Native American), one chapter at a time. These traditions are covered in great detail, and the author examines the geography, history, and culture associated with them and highlights important figures and tales. There is a great emphasis on the influence of psychology on the study of mythology. Early on, the author discusses the work of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Joseph Campbell and how they brought the importance of mythology into academic circles. Leeming concludes by discussing the idea of the monomyth, or Campbell's concept that there are certain motifs and themes that are common to many traditions and that transcend individual cultures. The glossary, index, and bibliography make this volume an excellent reference source, and the appendix takes it further, offering lists of characters and stories that fall under categories such as "The Great Earth Mother Goddess" and "The Hero Quest" and the pages where readers can find them.

All the bloody regimes and movements of the twentieth century are masterfully captured here, from Stalin's Soviet Union, Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, and Franco's Spain through to the modern scourge of terrorism. Eloquently and persuasively combining an authoritative survey of history with a timely reminder of the dangers of radical secularism, Burleigh asks why no one foresaw the religious implications of massive Third World immigration, and he deftly investigates what are now driving calls for a civic religion to counter the terrorist threats that have so shocked the West.</p></p><p><p>Michael Burleigh is the author of <em>Earthly Powers</em>, <em>Sacred Causes</em>, and <em>The Third Reich: A New History</em>, which won the Samuel Johnson Prize for Nonfiction. He is married and lives in London. </p>Reviewed by Mark Mazower<p> Perhaps in the United States, with its high rate of churchgoing, the importance of religion is obvious. But in Europe, the impact of faith on public life was, until recently, widely assumed to be in decline. Of course, episodes such as the Roman Catholic Church's alliance with Poland's Solidarity movement in the 1980s highlighted the oddity of thinking that religion was a medieval phenomenon, not a modern one. Yet for decades, theorists of progress predicted that the more societies modernized, the weaker the grip of religion would become: What lay at the end of the road was the inevitable triumph of secularism.</p><p> Quite rightly, Michael Burleigh wants none of this. His Sacred Causes -- a sprawling, uneven and irascible book -- argues that religion never went away. Not only did churches play a role in the resistance (and accommodation) to 20th-century totalitarianism of the Right and Left, but, in Burleigh's view, those ideologies were in fact political religions that borrowed their trappings, rhetoric, dogmatism and fervor from the church. There was, however, a key difference between religious leaders engaging in politics and political leaders demanding religion-like devotion. Christianity, Burleigh says, contributed to Europe's political culture by carving out a space beyond the power of the state. Stalin and Hitler, on the other hand, extended state power into previously private realms. Lethal, fake religions triumphed -- for a time -- over real, humane ones.</p><p> Burleigh defends the Catholic Church in particular. He claims its upper echelons, although inclined to authoritarianism, were more opposed to Hitler than people tend to think. There's no doubt where Burleigh's sympathies lie: Only when he comes to the liberation theology of Latin America, which views Jesus as a liberator of the oppressed, does his anti-Marxism temporarily trump his appreciation for the clergy. But this book is really about Europe. It is silent on political Hinduism in India, Sinhala Buddhist fundamentalism in Asia, evangelical missionaries in Africa and contemporary forms of Jewish nationalism in the Middle East. On Islam, it reproduces the apocalyptic slurs of post-9/11 punditry. While Burleigh does have plenty to say about the battle between religion and secularism on the Old Continent after 1945, little of it is positive. The Protestant churches -- full of their German hand-wringers and English do-gooders -- do not generally elicit from him the same understanding as the papacy, and in his account the sufferings of Orthodox Christianity under communism are counterbalanced by the fascist sympathies of the Romanian clergy. Northern Ireland is portrayed in the spirit of a plague on both houses.</p><p> One notices these things because Burleigh is nothing if not opinionated. He despises "sneering secularists" but is a considerable sneerer himself. Targets include "humanist radical eggheads," "tenured radicals" who take a "vampiric interest in female students," the "horde of bodgers and shysters" in the English construction trades and "dingy Irish theme pubs" with their "relentless, mindless gabbling." As the book moves on, jibes and bile clog the writing, and one has the sinking feeling of being cornered by the pub bore, ranting on about '60s swingers, the threat to European civilization, terrorists and trade unions -- pretty much everything and everyone except the pope, Ronald Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher. I would like to think that the old Burleigh, the fine historian who wrote some superb works on Nazism, is not gone. Maybe this lament for the disappearing "Christian Constitution of Britain" is really a tasteless spoof designed to show the reader where a certain kind of religious despair can leave you. Or perhaps it is simply what he thinks.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

Kouga is also the author of <i>Akuma no Riddle: Riddle Story of Devil.</i></p><h2>The Greek Epic Cycle (Bristol Classical Paperbacks)</h2><p><p>In the wake of Homer's "Iliad" and "Odyssey", poets of the seventh and sixth centuries BC composed epics which covered other parts of the Trojan War story or different areas of Greek mythology. Quotations from them and other testimonies as to their content survive in later authors and the evidence thus assembled allows us to reconstruct something of the poems' contents. Collectively these poems came to be known by Hellenistic scholars in Alexandria as 'The Epic Cycle'. With their often grotesque and fantastic tales, the cyclic poems were an important source for later writers of epic. Yet they also present a wealth of fascinating mythological details in their own right and provide absorbing variation on the traditional themes presented in Homer. Why are certain themes frequently used, while others are neglected in various poems? Such considerations enhance an overall appreciation of epic theme and outlook.

What she hung on to during this difficult time, as she relates in an interview, were books: "With all the moving around we did, the library was always a familiar place, a place of sanity. It was very much home." Nikki started writing at the age of six and has been a prolific writer ever since. When asked about her life as a writer, she said, "The written word has always had a special fascination for me. It seemed uncanny that words, spread across a page just so, had the power to transport me to another time or place. But they could. I spent many hours ensconced in the local library reading&#x2014;no, devouring&#x2014;book after book. Books were my soul&#x2019;s delight. Even so, in one sense, the stories I read betrayed me. Too few featured African Americans. Fewer still spoke to, or acknowledged the existence of, the particular problems I faced as a black foster child from a dysfunctional family and badly broken home. I couldn&#x2019;t articulate it then, but I sensed a need for validation that the books I read did not supply. When I grow up, I thought, I&#x2019;ll write books about children who look and feel like me." Her many titles include Jazmin&#x2019;s Notebook (Dial), a Coretta Scott King Award Honor Book; Meet Danitra Brown (Lothrop) also a Coretta Scott King Award Honor Book; Bronx Masquerade (Dial), winner of the 2003 Coretta Scott King Award; and Come Sunday (Eerdmans) winner of an ALA Notable Award for Poetry. She is an accomplished and widely anthologized poet and has conducted poetry readings and lectures at International Schools in Russia, China, Sweden, and Tanzania. In her latest book, At Break of Day, Nikki retells the creation story portraying God the Father and God the Son as artists who delight in their work. When asked why she wrote this book, Nikki said, "I wanted to explore facets of the story that haven&#x2019;t been presented before so that readers could experience the old story with, I hope, some of the excitement I felt when I first encountered the original." Nikki currently lives in Corona, California.</p><h2>Robotics Demystified (Demystified)</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>YOU DON'T NEED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO LEARN ROBOTICS!</b></p><p>Now anyone with an interest in robotics can gain a deeper understanding -- without formal training, unlimited time, or a genius IQ.

This practical book describes the wide and diverse range of bearings found in the large variety of different types of models built in home workshops.</p><p>Alex Weiss has a PhD in mechanical engineering from University College London and has been a practicing model engineer for the last twenty years. He has already produced two earlier volumes in the series, No 22 Workshop Electrics and No 30 Workshop Materials as well as Plastics for Modellers, which includes details of the plastics of use to model engineers. He has also had several articles published in Model Engineer.This is a member of the Workshop Practice Series of books that all set a very high standard and although they are primarily aimed at the model engineer, provide information that can be applied to full scale engineering projects and help the novice to understand technology and manufacturing processes. Many will think of ball bearings when the subject is discussed. The ball bearing system is ubiquitous and applied to an enormous range of machines, great and small, but is just one of several types of bearing. The author begins by explaining that a bearing is the point where two surfaces are connected together in a machine. Until the Industrial Revolution, the most common bearing was the wheel hub on wagon or carriage. This simple rotary bearing might be a wooden wheel on a wooden shaft, where the plain surfaces were lubricated by animal fat. The low speed of a wagon drawn by humans or other animals could be served adequately by this simple form of bearing. The Industrial Revolution introduced a rapidly expanding range of machines that required higher speed bearings and introduced more complex combinations of forces. There was also a need to build bearings that could operate in the marine environment and which needed to be waterproof. Over a period of two centuries, bearing design has been forced to keep pace with emerging technologies that require ever more sophisticated bearings. The model engineer faces all of the challenges of a full scale engineer, with the added challenge of building very small bearings that may operate at very high scale speeds and under extreme forces. These demanding bearings also have to operate for proportionately longer periods without any human intervention, particularly when used in radio controlled models. The author has explained in easy to understand descriptions which bearings are most suitable for specific applications and then gone on to describe the design and manufacturing processes and the maintenance of bearings. His clear text is ably supported by some very effective illustration, using a mixture of drawings and photographs. This is a book which is exceptionally good value for money and an essential part of any model engineer&#39;s library. It will also make a first class guide to bearings for any practical engineer and an ideal book for those learning about technology and the application of machines - firetrench.com.</p><h2>Quintana of Charyn: The Lumatere Chronicles</h2><p><b>"Vivid and wholly satisfying. . . .

Yet again, Marchetta seamlessly weaves together the personal and the political, exploring the larger societal implications of her characters&#x2019; actions while keeping a tight focus on their emotional lives. The obstacles in the relationships among her main characters mirror the tensions built by prejudices and ignorance throughout their lands, and the setbacks they experience as they work toward peace, both as a community and as individuals, are painfully authentic. The romances are sweet but tempered by reality, the triumphs are great but leave many scars, and even the happy ending here is bittersweet in its resolution.

With the attire and features of an Indian maiden and addressing Juan Diego in his native tongue she instructed him to tell the bishop to build a shrine on that spot. As a sign she left her image on his cloak - the miraculous image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Drawing on a lifetime of reflection Father Virgil Elizondo has written Guadalupe, an account of the story and meaning of one of the most powerful religious symbols of our day. For centuries Guadalupe has served as one of the sustaining symbols of Mexican, Latin American, and U.S. Hispanic identity and spirituality. But more than that, in this lyrical and inspiring work Elizondo shows that Our Lady of Guadalupe has an even wider significance and relevance to the church universal at the dawn of a new millennium.Virgil Elizondo was a theologian, pastor, and popular speaker nationwide. A former rector of San Fernando Cathedral, he was director of Archdiocesan Television Ministry for San Antonio, Texas, and the author of <i>God of Surprises</i> and <i>Galilean Journey.</i></p><h2>Stahlgewitter at the gates of Moscow Waffen SS in Combat a German view of WW2: Operation Barbarossa 1941 through German eyes</h2><p><p><strong>Stahlgewitter at the gates of Moscow - a German view of WW2</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The German Army Group Center achieved an overwhelming tactical victory during the twin battles of Bryansk and Vyazma during the first half of October 1941.

Appropriate clothing, which were field-tested and found to be sufficient for the Russian winter, were not yet available. Only the Luftwaffe and the Waffen-SS were to some extent better prepared.

No matter how rough or remote it might be, a road always leads somewhere, and for someone, that somewhere is home.</p><p>I lived on a back road, a narrow, twisting lane bordered by hedgerows, lush pastures, and shadowy woodlands. My home was a honey-colored cottage in the Cotswolds, a region of rolling hills and patchwork fields in England&#x2019;s West Midlands, and my little lane was used chiefly by my family, my friends, and my neighbors.</p><p>Bewildered strangers occasionally knocked on my door to ask for directions, but they left as quickly as they came. They had no reason to linger&#x2014;no castle, no cathedral, no Bronze Age barrow or seaside promenade to pique their interest. There was nothing special about my corner of the Cotswolds, apart from its tranquil beauty and the unchanging, ever-changing cycle of country life.</p><p>My husband, Bill, and I were Americans, as were our nine-year-old twins, Will and Rob, but we&#x2019;d lived in England long enough to be accepted as honorary natives by our neighbors. Our cottage was situated near the small village of Finch, a place so tiny and of so little consequence to the world at large that most mapmakers forgot to include it on their maps.</p><p>Finch was, of course, of tremendous consequence to those of us who lived there. It was the center of our universe, the hub around which we revolved. We might not be able to name the newest celebrity, but we knew everything worth knowing about one another.</p><p>We knew whose dog had acquired fleas, whose roof had sprung a leak, and whose chrysanthemums had been fatally stricken with root rot mere moments after such catastrophes took place. We knew who could be relied upon to make six dozen flawless strawberry tarts for the flower show&#x2019;s bake sale and who couldn&#x2019;t be trusted to bake a single macaroon without setting the oven ablaze. We knew whose children and grandchildren were delightful and whose were to be avoided like the plague, and we shared our knowledge with a diligence that put the Internet to shame.</p><p>Local gossip was the stuff of life in Finch, a sport, an art form, a currency that never lost its value. We didn&#x2019;t need celebrities to entertain us. We found ourselves endlessly fascinating.</p><p>Finch wouldn&#x2019;t suit everyone&#x2014;those desiring privacy, for example, would find the lack of it hard to bear&#x2014;but it suited Bill and me down to the ground. Bill ran the European branch of his family&#x2019;s venerable Boston law firm from an office overlooking the village green; Will and Rob attended Morningside School in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping; and I juggled a multitude of roles&#x2014;wife, mother, friend, neighbor, community volunteer, gossip gatherer, and devoted daughter-in-law.</p><p>Bill&#x2019;s father, William Willis, Sr., lived up the lane from us, in Fairworth House, a splendidly restored Georgian mansion surrounded by an impeccably maintained estate. Willis, Sr., had spent most of his adult life in Boston as the head of the family firm, but he&#x2019;d moved to England upon his retirement in order to be near his grandchildren.</p><p>My father-in-law was an old-fashioned, courtly gentleman, a handsome widower, and a doting grandfather. I adored him, as did nearly every widow and spinster in Finch. Many a heart had been broken when Willis, Sr., had bestowed his upon the celebrated watercolorist Amelia Thistle. Amelia had taken nearly two years to return the favor, but Willis, Sr.&#x2019;s patient pursuit of her had eventually paid off. He had proposed, she had accepted, and the date of the wedding had been set.</p><p>Bill was delighted by the match. He looked forward to being his father&#x2019;s best man as eagerly as I looked forward to being Amelia&#x2019;s matron of honor. Will and Rob were somewhat less enthusiastic about fulfilling their forthcoming roles as Grandpa&#x2019;s ring-bearers, but Amelia had bought their cooperation by promising to hide a handful of their favorite cookies in her bouquet. For a woman who&#x2019;d never had children of her own, Amelia possessed a rare gift for dealing with nine-year-olds.</p><p>Although Willis, Sr., was no longer the head of the family firm,he was still regarded as the head of the family and attendance at his nuptials was considered compulsory. Flocks of aunts, uncles, and cousins would soon be descending on Finch to pay homage to the paterfamilias, an event that did not fill Bill with unalloyed joy. While he got along well with most of his relatives, he actively disliked two of his aunts. He referred to them as the Harpies, but only when Will, Rob, and his father were out of earshot.</p><p>Though Aunt Honoria and Aunt Charlotte had been widowed for many years, they had, in their youth, married men from their own social milieu. They believed that Bill had let his old-money Boston Brahmin family down when he&#x2019;d married a middle-class girl from Chicago. Had they been openly hostile to me, Willis, Sr., would have come down on them like a ton of bricks, so they disguised their disdain with artful expressions of &#x201c;concern&#x201d; for me, the unfortunate outsider.</p><p>They criticized my posture, my table manners, my dress sense, and my speech, but they did so solicitously, as if they were bringing enlightenment to a savage who&#x2019;d been raised on a desert island by a troop of baboons. Willis, Sr., who could usually spot a hidden agenda from a mile off, was blind to his sisters&#x2019; shenanigans. He saw Charlotte and Honoria through rose-colored glasses, but they made my easygoing husband see red.</p><p>Bill&#x2019;s aunts had never darkened our doorway in England&#x2014;they rarely left Boston&#x2014;and he was not looking forward to their first visit. He made his misgivings known to me as we strolled along our little lane one day, three weeks before the wedding.</p><p>It was a glorious Saturday morning in early June. After dropping the boys off at the local stables for their weekly riding lessons, Bill had decided to clear up some neglected paperwork that awaited him at his office in Finch. He didn&#x2019;t usually walk to the village and I didn&#x2019;t usually accompany him, but the weather was superb and we&#x2019;d both felt like stretching our legs.</p><p>My mind was on other things when Bill spoke, so his words seemed to come out of nowhere, like a bolt from the blue.</p><p>&#x201c;If the Harpies are rude to you,&#x201d; he declared, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll strangle them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I should hope so,&#x201d; I said lightly, but one glance at my husband&#x2019;s thunderous expression told me that he was not in the mood for levity. &#x201c;What brought your aunts to mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A phone call from Father,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Honoria and Charlotte will be arriving at Fairworth House on Monday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Monday?&#x201d; I said, my heart sinking. &#x201c;Why so soon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They <i>say</i> they&#x2019;re coming early to help Amelia with the wedding, but you and I know they&#x2019;ll do nothing but nitpick and nag.&#x201d; Bill laughed bitterly. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t put it past them to spend the next three weeks trying to talk Father out of marrying Amelia.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fat chance,&#x201d; I said scornfully.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;An <i>artist</i> in the family,&#x2019;&#x201d; said Bill, mimicking Honoria&#x2019;s penetrating nasal drawl. &#x201c;&#x2018;What on earth were you <i>thinking</i>, William? We could understand it if she <i>dabbled</i>. Everyone <i>dabbles</i>. But she <i>sells</i> her paintings. For <i>money</i>. My dear, it simply isn&#x2019;t <i>done</i>!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t be stupid enough to talk like that in front of your father, would they?&#x201d; I asked incredulously.</p><p>&#x201c;I almost wish they would,&#x201d; said Bill. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d be a treat to watch Father kick them out of Fairworth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If they spout off about Amelia, he will,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And they won&#x2019;t be able to stay with us because we don&#x2019;t have a guest room anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yet another reason to be thankful for my beautiful wife,&#x201d; Bill acknowledged, &#x201c;and my beautiful, beautiful daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>My husband&#x2019;s entire aspect changed as he gazed down at the precious passenger I was pushing along in the pram. His shoulders relaxed, his fists unclenched, and his thunderous expression gave way to one of pure adoration. Bill was in love as he had never been in love before and I felt not the slightest twinge of jealousy because I, too, was besotted.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. We loved our sons ferociously, but our baby girl had come to us long after we&#x2019;d abandoned hope of having another child. Her late arrival had secured a special place in our hearts for her. Because of her, Bill had done the unthinkable: He&#x2019;d cut back on his workload in order to spend less time at the beck and call of his demanding clients and more time at home with his family. It was a choice the Harpies would never understand, but I did, and I approved of it with all my heart.</p><p>Our daughter had been christened Elizabeth Dimity, after my late mother and a dear friend, but Will and Rob had dubbed her Bess. I suspected they&#x2019;d done so for the pleasure of calling her Bessy Boots, Messy Bessy, and a host of other big-brotherly nicknames, but Bess she had been from that day forward.</p><p>Bess had entered the world on a stormy, snowy night in late February&#x2014;a scant fifteen weeks ago&#x2014;but we felt as if we&#x2019;d known her forever. She had her father&#x2019;s velvety brown eyes, my rosy complexion, and a wispy crop of silky, softly curling dark-brown hair.</p><p>&#x201c;She <i>is</i> beautiful, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; I crooned.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s incomparably beautiful,&#x201d; Bill agreed, &#x201c;and highly intelligent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And even-tempered,&#x201d; I added.</p><p>&#x201c;And healthy and strong and good-humored,&#x201d; Bill continued.</p><p>&#x201c;And kind and patient and wise,&#x201d; I went on.</p><p>&#x201c;Our Bess,&#x201d; Bill concluded, &#x201c;is as perfectly perfect as perfect can be.&#x201d;</p><p>We looked at each other and laughed. We wouldn&#x2019;t allow ourselves to become baby-bores in public, but we were free to sing Bess&#x2019;s praises in private, secure in the knowledge that every word we said was true.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s also considerate,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;If we hadn&#x2019;t turned our guest room into her nursery, we would have had to offer it to one of your cousins.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank God for small blessings,&#x201d; Bill murmured, beaming at Bess. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where Father will put everyone,&#x201d; he added, shaking his head. &#x201c;Fairworth House is big, but it isn&#x2019;t big enough to accomodate his out-of-town guests as well as Amelia&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He could put someone in the old nursery,&#x201d; I suggested facetiously. Willis, Sr., had refurbished the nursery in Fairworth House with his granddaughter&#x2019;s comfort in mind. It came in handy when our visits coincided with Bess&#x2019;s nap times, but it wasn&#x2019;t a bedroom for grown-ups.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you serious?&#x201d; Bill asked, eyeing me doubtfully.</p><p>&#x201c;I was attempting to be humorous,&#x201d; I said, sighing. &#x201c;An attempt which has clearly failed. The serious answer is: Amelia has booked hotel rooms in Oxford and Upper Deeping for those who accepted their invitations promptly. Late responders will have to fend for themselves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose they could rent the empty cottages,&#x201d; said Bill.</p><p>A sense of unease rippled through me. The empty cottages worried me far more than Bill&#x2019;s aunts. Honoria and Charlotte would be gone shortly after the wedding, but the cottages were part of a troubling trend.</p><p>Two cottages stood empty in Finch and they had done so for five months. Their former owners had either passed away or moved away, and though the little dwellings were attractive and in good repair, no new owners had come to claim them.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t understand it. Finch might be small, but it was not without resources. Taxman&#x2019;s Emporium stocked everything from baked beans to freckle cream, Peacock&#x2019;s pub was renowned for its pub grub and ales, and Sally Cook&#x2019;s tearoom was a pastry lover&#x2019;s delight. Finch had its own church, post office, and greengrocer&#x2019;s shop and it boasted the finest handyman in the county. Mr. Barlow, the retired mechanic who served as our church sexton, could turn his hand to just about any job.</p><p>Finch even had an international contingent. Bree Pym was from New Zealand, Jack MacBride was from Australia, and my family represented the United States, as did my best friend, Emma Harris, who lived up the lane from us in Anscombe Manor, where she&#x2019;d established the riding academy Will and Rob attended. Our village was, in its own way, quite cosmopolitan.</p><p>Granted, there was no school, but the old schoolhouse was still very much in use as our village hall. The flower show, the Nativity play, and numerous bake sales were held there, and committees met beneath its roof to plan the year&#x2019;s village activities.</p><p>Finch was surrounded by farmland, but Oxford wasn&#x2019;t far away and Upper Deeping was even closer. It seemed to me that a relatively short drive to work was a small price to pay for a home in such a beautiful setting.</p><p>Fishermen could cast their lures into the Little Deeping River, cyclists could pedal in peace along uncrowded lanes, hikers could ramble to their hearts&#x2019; content on a network of lovely trails, and children could play in safety on the village green while the elderly swapped stories on the bench near the war memorial. All in all, Finch had a lot to offer.</p><p>Yet the two cottages remained empty.</p><p>&#x201c;There shouldn&#x2019;t be <i>any</i> empty cottages in Finch,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They should&#x2019;ve been snapped up ages ago. What&#x2019;s wrong with people, Bill? Why doesn&#x2019;t anyone want to live here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No idea,&#x201d; said Bill. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s too nice a day to waste fretting over a problem we can&#x2019;t solve.&#x201d;</p><p>I fell silent, but I didn&#x2019;t stop fretting. It distressed me to see Ivy Cottage and Rose Cottage uninhabited. Their blank windows seemed to peer reproachfully at passersby, as if the village had somehow let them down. Amelia&#x2019;s home, Pussywillows, would soon be on the market as well and I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering if it would find a buyer. The thought of <i>three</i> perfectly good cottages standing vacant for months on end was as depressing as it was perplexing.</p><p>Bill spoke of everything but the empty cottages as we strolled past Emma Harris&#x2019;s long, curving drive, Bree Pym&#x2019;s redbrick house, and the wrought-iron gates guarding the entrance to Willis, Sr.&#x2019;s estate. We were within a few yards of the humpbacked bridge that crossed the Little Deeping when I came to a halt.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s where we part ways,&#x201d; I said to Bill, nodding toward the trees on our right. &#x201c;If you squint, you&#x2019;ll see an old cart track hidden away in there. Bess and I are heading for parts unknown.&#x201d;</p><p>Bill pushed aside the branches of the bushy bay tree that concealed the track&#x2019;s narrow entrance.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad I bought an all-terrain pram,&#x201d; he said, eyeing the track&#x2019;s deep ruts doubtfully. &#x201c;Do you have your cell phone with you, in case you get lost?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do have my cell phone with me,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but I won&#x2019;t need it. According to Emma, the track hugs the northern boundary of your father&#x2019;s property, so I can&#x2019;t possibly get lost.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma Harris was not merely a good friend and an accomplished equestrian. She was a master map-reader as well. She&#x2019;d spotted the disused farm track on an old ordnance survey map, but though she&#x2019;d told me of her discovery, she hadn&#x2019;t yet explored it. It cheered me to think of Bess and I going boldly where no Emma had gone before.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t walk too far,&#x201d; Bill cautioned.</p><p>&#x201c;Forty minutes out, forty minutes back,&#x201d; I promised. &#x201c;Unless the track vanishes before our out-time is up, in which case we&#x2019;ll turn around sooner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A sensible plan,&#x201d; said Bill, adding under his breath, &#x201c;if only you&#x2019;d stick to it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He gave me a kiss and bent low to ...</p></p><h2>Shape Up as you sit, stand and walk, it&#39;s nature&#39;s Miracle Exercise: Shape Up as you sit, stand and walk, it&#39;s nature&#39;s Miracle Exercise</h2><p>Shape up as you sit, stand, walk is a small self-help fitness guide that includes an amazing way to gain energy, flexibility, strength and even self-confidence by improving your posture, no matter the age of the reader.

It explains why physical and mental activities influence longevity and why, as we age, we need to stretch and tone muscles that will help us to maintain balance, flexibility and agility so that we can remain active and self-reliant, even into our senior years. Spine alignment, or posture, is the theme of the second chapter called The Miracle Exercise. This chapter is what makes this book so unique. The author explains and illustrates why, without proper posture, we can't be physically fit, as it influences our health and fitness level and every move we make. Since we all have a problem focusing on our posture; remembering to sit and stand tall without slouching; in this chapter the reader will learn how and why one amazing image, called the miracle diamond will do it for us! The image describes and explains the one simple exercise, based on the principles of Yoga and Pilates that can not only eliminate slouching, but strengthen core muscles and align the spine. The Miracle Exercise image page can be cut apart and posted in places should as the car, bathroom mirror or computer as a posture-reminder. Within weeks, as posture improves, the result gained will be increased energy, vitality and flexibility. It will prove to be a gift that keeps on giving. The third chapter, called Shower Power, illustrates how the readers can include as many as eighteen simple but powerful stretching exercises while showering or after a shower with a towel. Each exercise is illustrated and can be even more effective when rhythmic breathing is included. It demonstrates how, when muscles are warm and resilient we can relax, realign and revitalize our body, preparing it for the day's activities. The book includes two meditation exercises that can be done lying down or sitting in a chair. As deep rhythmic breathing is not only used in meditation but makes every stretching exercise more powerful, the author uses imagery to describe how to deep breathe as an exercise. This book was written to help the reader understand that it's what we do consistently, as part of our lifestyle, that is the secret to successfully becoming fit and able to live a full and active life.</p><p>Helen Fleder, a former ballet dancer, professional sculptor and published author has been involved in the arts for over 70 years.

Antagonism toward reproductive freedom, partner rights, and transgender rights has revealed a new and unacknowledged era of southern reconstruction centered on gender and sexuality.<br><br> In <i>A Dirty South Manifesto,</i> L.&nbsp;H. Stallings celebrates the roots of radical sexual resistance in the New South&#x2014;a movement that is antiracist, decolonial, and transnational. For people within economically disenfranchised segments of society, those in sexually marginalized communities, and the racially oppressed, the South has been a sexual dystopia. Throughout this book, Stallings delivers hard-hitting manifestos for the new sex wars. With her focus on contemporary Black southern life, Stallings offers an invitation to anyone who has ever imagined a way of living beyond white supremacist heteropatriarchy.</p><p>"In this brilliant, imaginative, and defiant manifesto, Stallings entices the reader into reimagining and rereading the South, specifically the Dirty South. Leaning in on southern hip-hop, Millie Jackson, and other forms of (deviant) southern culture, Stallings makes legible the multiple sites and literacies of sexual politics and resistance found throughout the new South. However, her path to freedom is not limited to public protest, social movements, and electoral politics; it also includes the underground, where strategies of decolonization and magic allow nonnormative joy, intimacy, and sexual pleasure to flourish. Stallings&#x2019;s unflinching and creative look at the Dirty South&nbsp;challenges our current understandings of moral authority while unveiling a new vision of liberation and freedom."&#x2014;Cathy J. Cohen, author of <i>Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics?</i><br><br> "Always at the vanguard of critical work in sexuality studies, Stallings has produced one of the most important manifestos about queerness and southern-ness, about family and empire. For those familiar with and unsettled by the parameters set forth in Patsy Yaeger&#x2019;s <i>Dirt and Desire</i> (2000), this manifesto is a necessary intervention. Stallings takes us where we need to go and returns to us our whole southern selves, arguing for renewed attention to the region and its cultural producers and products, and&nbsp;for a whole-scale dismissal of 'settler sexuality'&nbsp;that chokes the lifeblood out of this place we call home and the people we embrace who survive within it. What better place to home in on how to deal with white supremacy&#x2019;s creep in these United States than the place in the nation where such ideologies flourish in a particular way? In these pages, life is indeed messy and sexy too, but along the way Stallings gives us back our lexicon and its theory to sustain us through what has arrived and is surely, also, yet to come."&#x2014;Sharon P. Holland, author of <i>The Erotic Life of Racism</i><br><br> "An exceptional and imperative queer feminist analysis of morality and Black sexual politics in the south. Stallings draws from the belowground of Dirty South archives to declare lessons for Black sexual freedom and resistance manifested in fearless illicit literacies cultivated through sensual temporalities, sonic seductions, and sacred energies."&#x2014;Deborah R. Vargas,&nbsp;Associate Professor of Women&#x2019;s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Rutgers University<br><br> &#x201c;Stallings has a gift of cutting to the chase without sacrificing context or argument. This impressive book holds a mountain of history and insight into the deeply vexing region that is the South&#x2014;neither vilifying it nor shying away from its warts. I can&#x2019;t wait to teach it.&#x201d;&#x2014;E. Patrick Johnson, author of <i>Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity</i>&nbsp;"Imploring each of us to become &#x2018;a connoisseur of dirt,&#x2019; Stallings launches a call to arms on behalf of scholar-activists invested in contemporary queer studies of the U.S. South. A stellar contribution to the American Studies Now series."&#x2014;Scott Herring, author of <i>The Hoarders: Material Deviance in Modern American Culture</i><b>L.H. Stallings</b> is Professor of African American Studies at Georgetown University. She is the author of <i>Mutha' is Half a Word!

Rather than move the plot forward with painstaking precision, gradually establishing the magnitude of it all, Fraction serves it up at an absolutely screaming pace, trusting the reader to see the hectic art mirroring the unfolding events.. The eponymous Casanova Quinn finds himself kidnapped into a parallel universe, where he must work at the behest of the forces of evil in order to bring down EMPIRE, an organization dedicated to international law enforcement headed by his own father. Keeping everything straight is a challenge for Quinn, and on more than one occasion he thinks he's losing his mind. The frenetic line work of Ba (The Umbrella Academy, Daytripper) is just what the narrative needs, especially when accompanied by the excellent coloring of Cris Peter, using a very selective palette. The reader will also appreciate Fraction's supercool touches, such as popping God into the margins to explain what's happening. -- Publishers Weekly<br><br></p><h2>The Modern Art of High Intensity Training</h2><p><p> A book on high intensity training should deliver an impact equal to the training itself.

With <em>Hide Me Among the Graves,</em> it&#x2019;s possible that the uniquely ingenious Powers has surpassed even himself. A breathtaking historical thriller in which art and the supernatural collide, <em>Hide Me Among the Graves</em> transports readers back to mid-19th century London and features a reformed ex-prostitute, a veterinarian, and the vampire ghost of Lord Byron&#x2019;s onetime physician, uncle to poet Christina Rossetti and her brother, the painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti. A novel that, like all his others, is virtually impossible to pidgeonhole&#x2014;or to resist&#x2014;<em>Hide Me Among the Graves</em> is the taut, gripping, and utterly remarkable literary thrill ride that Tim Powers fans have been eagerly waiting for.</p></p><p><p>London, winter of 1862, Adelaide McKee, a former prostitute, arrives on the doorstep of veterinarian John Crawford, a man she met once seven years earlier. Their brief meeting produced a child who, until now, had been presumed dead. McKee has learned that the girl lives&#x2014;but that her life and soul are in mortal peril from a vampiric ghost. But this is no ordinary spirit; the bloodthirsty wraith is none other than John Polidori, the onetime physician to the mad, bad, and dangerous Romantic poet Lord Byron. Both McKee and Crawford have mysterious histories with creatures like Polidori, and their child is a prize the malevolent spirit covets dearly.</p><p>Polidori is also the late uncle and supernatural muse to the poet Christina Rossetti and her brother, the painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti. When she was just fourteen years old, Christina unwittingly brought Polidori's curse upon her family. And when Polidori resurrects Dante's dead wife&#x2014;turning her into a horrifying vampire&#x2014;and threatens other family members, Christina and Dante agree that they must destroy their monstrous uncle and break the spell. Determined to save their daughter, McKee and Crawford join forces with the Rossettis, and soon these wildly mismatched allies are plunged into a supernatural London underworld whose existence goes beyond their wildest imaginings.</p><p>Tim Powers is the author of numerous novels including <em>Hide Me Among the Graves, Three Days to Never, Declare, Last Call,</em> and <em>On Stranger Tides,</em> which inspired the feature film <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.</em> He has won the Philip K.

Invest in nothing but these bonds and you&#x2019;re guaranteed a 4-percent haul. The only problem with such a strategy, especially for the millions of soon-to-be-retired baby boomers, is that, at 4 percent, it takes 18 years to double your money. In addition, after 18 years, even with a low inflation rate of 2 to 3 percent, most of the gain is absorbed by higher prices, leaving you with only slightly more buying power than you had 18 years earlier. Despite this reality, investors buy billions of dollars of these 4-percent bonds.<br><br>Why in the world would anyone want to own a bond that barely keeps pace with inflation and realizes almost no real gain in wealth? Because almost everyone is convinced that a higher rate of return necessarily means a lot more risk. And they&#x2019;re more afraid of losing money in an attempt to get a higher return than of their inability to retire comfortably.<br><br>The fact is, a higher rate of return is not necessarily contingent on incurring significantly more risk. Let me explain.<br><b>HIGH RETURNS DON&#x2019;T NECESSARILY MEAN MORE RISK<br><br></b>During a talk at the America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona, I asked the audience, &#x201c;How many of you drove your cars here today?&#x201d; Most people raised their hands. &#x201c;Okay, almost everybody. And how many of you took a huge risk driving here?&#x201d; A few hands went back up. &#x201c;You guys took a <i>huge </i>risk driving here?&#x201d; I asked incredulously. &#x201c;Either you drivers didn&#x2019;t really take a risk and are just clowning around, or at last we&#x2019;ve found the problem with Phoenix traffic&#x2014;you people with your hands up don&#x2019;t know how to drive. Is that it?&#x201d; Everybody laughed. &#x201c;Okay, so it wasn&#x2019;t so terrifying to drive down here. But now imagine that you&#x2019;re coming here but instead of <i>you </i>doing the driving, it&#x2019;s your eleven-year-old nephew behind the wheel. Are you taking a lot of risk now?&#x201d; People laughed and nodded yes. &#x201c;The trip was the same&#x2014;going from Ato B. But when you put someone in the driver&#x2019;s seat who doesn&#x2019;t know how to drive, a relatively safe trip becomes an incredibly risky trip.&#x201d;<br><br>Exactly the same thing holds true for your journey to financial freedom. If you don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re doing, your journey is going to be either very slow or very dangerous. That&#x2019;s why most people think that going fast (going after a high rate of return) is dangerous&#x2014;because they don&#x2019;t know how to drive the financial car, and not because going fast is <i>necessarily </i>dangerous. It&#x2019;s only dangerous if you don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re doing. And the essence of Rule #1 is knowing what you&#x2019;re doing&#x2014;investing with certainty so you <i>don&#x2019;t lose money!<br><br></i>Now, you&#x2019;re probably wondering, &#x201c;What about mutual funds? What about all those techniques we learn to minimize risk and maximize returns?&#x201d; Well, folks, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but here&#x2019;s the truth: Being a mutual fund investor is a whole lot riskier than being a Rule #1 investor. Investing in a mutual fund is, in many ways, like handing your car keys to that 11-year-old nephew.<br><b>THE MUTUAL FUND SCAM<br><br></b>If you own mutual funds that are attempting to beat the market, and you&#x2019;re hoping your fund manager can give you a nice retirement, you&#x2019;re highly likely to be the victim of a huge scam. You&#x2019;re not alone&#x2014;100 million investors are right there with you. <i>Fortune </i>magazine reports that since 1985 only 4 percent of all the fund managers beat the S&amp;P 500 index, and the few who did it did so by only a small margin. In other words, almost no fund managers have done what they&#x2019;re paid by you to do&#x2014;beat the market. That significant fact went unnoticed through the roaring 1980s and 1990s as the stock market surged with double-digit growth, bringing your fund manager along for the joyride. But now the ride is over, and investors are starting to notice that their fund managers are pretty much useless. This is not a new observation.<br><br>Several years ago, Warren Buffett said this about your fund manager: &#x201c;Professionals in other fields, like dentists, bring a lot to the layman, but people get nothing for their money from professional money managers.&#x201d; The key word here is <i>nothing. </i>And yet, what do you do? You give your hard-earned money to one of these guys and hope he can deliver those 15-percent-or-better returns, like the ones you got in the 1990s. Why? Because you don&#x2019;t want to invest your own money, and because you&#x2019;ve been convinced by the entire financial services industry that you can&#x2019;t do it yourself.<br><br>Come on, get real. From 2000 to 2003, mutual funds lost half their value. You could have lost 50 percent of your money without the help of a professional. In fact, in 1996 a monkey was hired to compete with the best fund managers in New York. He beat them two years in a row. When I told this story one day to an audience in Los Angeles, someone from the upper deck in the Arrowhead Pond Arena yelled out, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the name of the chimp?&#x201d; This is proof that some people will do anything to avoid investing their own money.<br><br>Peter Lynch, one of the few fund managers who made above-market returns and then got out before the market leveled him, wrote in his book <i>One Up on Wall Street </i>that the amateur investor has &#x201c;numerous built-in advantages, which, if exploited, should result in outperforming the market and the experts.&#x201d; In other words, you should be doing this yourself. But you don&#x2019;t. The reason you don&#x2019;t is that the entire financial services industry perpetuates three myths of investing to keep people investing with them in spite of the industry&#x2019;s dismal performance over any long period.<br><b>THE THREE MYTHS OF INVESTING<br><br><i>Myth 1. You Have to Be an Expert to Manage Money.<br></i></b>The first myth I want to bust is that it takes a lot of time and expertise to manage your money. It would if investing were hard to learn or if getting the information to make a decision took a lot of time. I&#x2019;ll prove to you that it doesn&#x2019;t, even though the financial services industry wants us to believe it does. The industry stands to make billions from commissions and fees if it can keep you thinking you can&#x2019;t do it on your own.<br><br>The Internet has changed everything. Now the tools that used to cost $50,000 a year are available for less than two bucks a day and take only minutes a day to use instead of 50 hours a week. And the Internet tools are more accurate, more timely, and easier to apply than anything your fund manager had just a couple of years ago. All you need is a little instruction and a brief learning period. But don&#x2019;t bother to ask your broker, financial planner/adviser, certified public accountant (CPA), or fund manager if you should do this on your own. You know what <i>they&#x2019;re </i>going to say. Something like, &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s what I do for you, so you don&#x2019;t have to worry about it.&#x201d; Well, you should worry about it. Alot. It&#x2019;s your money and you&#x2019;re the only one who really cares about what happens to it.<br><br>Even the pros like Jim Cramer, a guy who&#x2019;s in your corner and who wants to see you invest on your own, doesn&#x2019;t really know what it&#x2019;s like to be one of us. Like the rest of the top of the financial industry, Jim&#x2019;s Ivy League, incredibly smart, loves playing with stocks all day and night, lives it and breathes it and has no sense of what it&#x2019;s like to be you and me out there digging ditches someplace and hoping we can retire. For these guys it&#x2019;s a game. Aserious game, but still a game. Jim&#x2019;s a trader and loves to speculate. Following his approach, you&#x2019;ve got to put in five to ten hours a week minimum and you&#x2019;re playing a very dangerous game with money you can&#x2019;t afford to lose against really rich, really smart, and really motivated guys&#x2014;guys just like Jim.<br><br>If you think you can win at that game, be my guest. And if you do win, my hat goes off to you. You&#x2019;re a lot smarter than the rest of us. For everybody else, me included, there has to be another way. Most of us don&#x2019;t have five hours a week for investing. Let&#x2019;s face it. We&#x2019;ve got kids to raise, lives to live, and jobs that already take more time than we have. We also don&#x2019;t want to be chained to watching the stock market or to become frantic day traders. What fun would that be? We&#x2019;re just looking for something to invest in that gets really great returns without the risk of losing money and without spending a lot of time at it.<br><br>Rule #1 is investing for the rest of us.<br><br><b><i>Myth 2. You Can&#x2019;t Beat the Market.<br></i></b>Okay, it&#x2019;s true that 96 percent of all mutual fund managers have not been able to beat the market in the last 20 years. But you&#x2019;re not a fund manager and you&#x2019;re not judged by whether you beat the market. Your<br>financial skill is judged by whether you&#x2019;re living comfortably when you&#x2019;re 75. You shouldn&#x2019;t care whether you beat the market. If the market goes down 50 percent but your fund manager loses only 40 percent of your money, he may have beaten the market, but does that seem good to you? Rule #1 investors expect a minimum annual compounded rate of return of 15 percent a year or more. If we can get that, we don&#x2019;t care what the market did. We&#x2019;re going to retire rich anyway. Judged by that standard, Rule #1 investors . . . well, rule.<br><br>The myth that you can&#x2019;t beat the market was started in the 1970s by, among others, Professor Burton Malkiel of Princeton University, who did lots of research purporting to prove that nobody beats the market. (We&#x2019;ll be going into greater detail regarding Malkiel&#x2019;s theories later on in this book, but we must mention him here to debunk this myth.) His book, <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street, </i>still sells. He influenced a generation of professors in business schools who, as a body, subscribed to what has become known as Efficient Market Theory (EMT). EMT says markets in general (and the stock market in particular) are efficient&#x2014; that is, they price things according to their value. In the stock market, the ups and downs of the market are caused by rational investors responding minute by minute to the events that may affect their investments. According to EMT, the market is <i>so </i>efficient that everything that can be known about a company is already, minute by minute, figured into the price of its stock. In other words, the price of the stock at all times equals the value of the company.<br><br>If that&#x2019;s true, say the professors who believe in EMT, then it&#x2019;s simply not possible to find a stock that&#x2019;s undervalued, and it&#x2019;s equally impossible to pay too much for a stock. Why? Because price is always equal to value. So there are no deals in the market, and there are no rip-offs. This situation, EMT theorists say, accounts for the fact that almost no fund managers ever beat the market. These fund managers are smart guys, and if none of them beats the market for long periods, then the market must be perfectly pricing everything.<br><br>But some people do beat the market for long periods, and the point of this book is to show you how. You&#x2019;ll soon realize how false EMT really is.<br><br>[ In 1984, Warren Buffett gave a lecture at Columbia Business School in which he showed that at least 20 investors, who he&#x2019;d predicted would have high rates of return, all beat the target of 15 percent handsomely for periods longer than 20 years. All of these investors hailed from the same school of investing, which he called &#x201c;Graham-and-Doddsville&#x201d; because all had either learned from professors Graham and Dodd, from Buffett, or from someone who was copying Buffett&#x2014;the same way I learned from my teacher and the way you&#x2019;re learning from me. (Benjamin Graham was Buffett&#x2019;s teacher at Columbia; David Dodd was another professor at the school.) The compounded annual rate of return for these investors over eight decades ranged from 18 percent to 33 percent per year. The point Buffett was making to the Columbia students was that the people he knows who make over 15 percent a year for long periods <i>all do it similarly. </i>They all start with Rule #1.]<br><br>After the 2000 to 2003 stock market debacle, when some very good businesses saw their stock values drop by 90 percent, Professor Malkiel was interviewed, and as we&#x2019;ll see in Chapter 8, he came as close to a retraction of his theory as an academician ever could when he admitted that &#x201c;the market is generally efficient . . . but do[es] go crazy from time to time.&#x201d; Oh. It&#x2019;s efficient but sometimes it&#x2019;s not. Funny, but I thought that was what Buffett and Graham had been saying for 80 years. Buffett quips that he hopes the business schools will continue to turn out fund managers who believe in EMT so that he&#x2019;ll continue to have lots of misinformed fund managers to buy businesses from when they price them too cheap, and to sell businesses to when they&#x2019;re willing to pay too much.<br><br>The chart on page 18 shows how Rule #1 investors have fared over the last several decades, as compared with the performance of the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.<br><br>(Chart shows How Rule #1 investors have fared in comparison with the market&#x2019;s most popular indexes. This chart may appear erroneous or exaggerated, but it&#x2019;s not. Rule #1 investors outperform the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by a long shot&#x2014;routinely. The magic of compound growth is what explains the massive difference between compounding at 8 or 9 percent per year versus compounding a little over 23 percent per year. Such a huge difference isn&#x2019;t so obvious at first glance. Because 23 percent is just three times bigger than 8 percent, one would automatically think the dollars should just be three times bigger. But compounding growth is not linear, it&#x2019;s what is called geometric. Compounding grows a rate of return not only on the original dollar invested, but also on the accumulating dollar returns (&#x201c;interest on interest&#x201d;). Because 23 percent produces a higher dollar return every year, which, in turn, has a 23 percent return on it, the accelerating dollar amount explodes after several years and rockets far from the lower 8-percent compounded return.<br><br>Cool, huh?)<br><b><i>Myth 3.

With clarity and wisdom, Singer examines the images and words in each plate of Blake's work, applying in her analysis the concepts that Jung brought forth in his psychological theories. Originally published as <i>The Unholy Bible</i>. Index. Bibliography. 24 plates. Part of the <i>Jung on the Hudson Book Series.</i></p><p>More than ever, the time is ripe for June Singer's penetrating commentary on William Blake's work, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. For even the most devout literary scholars and art historians, much of Blake's mystical visions and writings are perplexing. With his pen and brush, he gave birth to mythological figures and fantastic metaphors. Singer shows us that Blake was actually tapping into the collective unconscious and giving form and voice to primordial psychological energies, or archetypes, that he experienced in his inner and outer world. Blake's writing and art was his personal dialogue between God and his own inner self -- a reconciliation of duality -- in which we can find clues to contemporary issues.<p>In the 18th century, Blake was a pioneer in finding, nurturing, and celebrating his personal connection with the divine, a search that still appeals to people who are coming to terms with the contemporary struggle between science and spirituality -- the conflict between reason and imagination. With clarity and wisdom, Singer examines the images and words in each plate of Blake's work, applying in her analysis the concepts that C. G. Jung advanced in his psychological theories. There is no more perfect lens with which to look at Blake's work than that of Jung's concepts of the archetypes, the process of individuation, and the mysterium coniunctionis, in which consciousness and the unconscious are united.</p><p>This edition includes a new preface by Jung Singer and a reproduction of 24 pages from Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.</p><p>June Singer is best known for her classic work <i>Boundaries of the Soul</i>, which has been a major influence in popularizing Jung's work. Her other books include: <i>Modern Woman in Search of Soul</i>, <i>Androgyny</i>, and <i>Blake, Jung, and the Collective Unconscious</i>. A Zurich-trained Jungian psychoanalyst, member of the C. G. Jung Institute of San Francisco and founding member of the Chicago Institute, June Singer lives in Cleveland, where she maintains a private practice in Jungian analysis and transpersonal psychotherapy.</p></p><h2>Modelling and Painting Figures (Modelling Manuals)</h2><p>Probably the greatest test of the modeller is achieving the perfectly posed figure. This title explains how best to set up the figure, and goes on to deal with the niceties of painting, facial expressions, clothing etc. With no detail unexplored, everything is clearly explained with step by step photos.</p><p>A perfect combination of easy-to-follow text combined with comprehensive step-by-step photography make Osprey Modelling Manuals indispensable reference guides for modellers of all standards and abilities.</p><h2>Flashman and the Cobra (Adventures of Thomas Flashman)</h2><p>This is the second instalment in the life story of Thomas Flashman, the uncle of the notorious Victorian rogue Harry Flashman, whose memoirs have already been published, edited by George MacDonald Fraser. Thomas shares many of the family traits, particularly the ability to find himself reluctantly at the sharp end of many major events of his age. This book takes him to territory familiar to readers of his nephew&#39;s adventures, India, during the second Mahratta war. It also includes an illuminating visit to Paris during the Peace of Amiens in 1802. As you might expect Flashman is embroiled in treachery and scandal from the outset and, despite his very best endeavours, is often in the thick of the action. He intrigues with generals, warlords, fearless warriors, nomadic bandit tribes, highland soldiers and not least a four-foot-tall former nautch dancer, who led the only Mahratta troops to leave the battlefield of Assaye in good order. Flashman gives an illuminating account with a unique perspective. It details feats of incredible courage (not his, obviously) reckless folly and sheer good luck that were to change the future of India and the career of a general who would later win a war in Europe.</p><p></p><h2>Human: A Portrait of Our World</h2><p>Over the past three years, Yann Arthus-Bertrand and the GoodPlanet Foundation have gathered more than 2,000 interviews in 70 countries, while capturing portraits and aerial photographs. <i>Human</i> explores fundamental themes&#x2014;Justice, Tolerance, Poverty, War, Happiness, and more&#x2014;and each chapter includes excerpts from interviews and essays written by eminent journalists and human rights activists.

It was a triumph of engineering but with profound consequences for more than 2,000 persons in the flooded Ashokan Valley. Elevem communites were razed for the mammoth project. 2,000 graves were disinterred and relocated. The story is told in all aspects: political, social, engineering.

Under the direction of impresario extraordinaire Serge Diaghilev (1872&#x2013;1929), the Ballets Russes radically transformed the nature of ballet&#x2014;its subject matter, movement idiom, choreographic style, stage space, music, scenic design, costume, even the dancer's physical appearance. From 1909 to 1929, it nurtured some of the greatest choreographers in dance history&#x2014;Fokine, Nijinsky, Massine, and Balanchine&#x2014;and created such classics as <i>Les Sylphides, Firebird, Petrouchka, L'Apr�s-midi d'un Faune, Les Noces,</i> and <i>Apollo.</i> Diaghilev brought together some of the leading artists of his time, including composers Stravinsky, Debussy, and Prokofiev; artists Picasso, Braque, and Matisse, and poets Hoffmansthal and Cocteau. <i>Diaghilev's Ballets Russes</i> is the most authoritative history of the company ever written and the first to examine it as a totality&#x2014;its art, enterprise, and audience. Combining social and cultural history with illuminating discussions of dance, drama, music, art, economics, and public reception, Lynn Garafola paints an extraordinary portrait of the company that shaped ballet into what it is today.</p><p>Dance critic and historian <b>Lynn Garafola </b>is the editor of <i>Rethinking the Sylph: New Perspectives on the Romantic Edition</i> and coeditor of<i> Andr� Levinson on Dance: Writings from Paris in the Twenties.</i> She lives in New York City.The Ballets Russes, in existence from 1909 to 1929, heraled modernism in ballet. The company's infamous impresario, Serge Diaghilev, had an uncommon facility for recognizing talent and fostering successful collaborations. He brought together innovative artists, dancers, composers, and choreographers in groundbreaking productions such as L'Apr es-Midi d'un Faune . Fokine, Nijinsky, Picasso, Stravinsky, Massine, Bakst, and Balanchine were just a few of the key players in the company's history. Garafola's approach to dance history is expansive, taking in the cultural and artistic influences and economic realities, and applying newer methodologies. Scholarly, yet extremely readable, this is highly recommended for most libraries, even those owning Richard Buckle's Diaghilev (LJ 10/1/79).<br><i>- Joan Stahl, Enoch Pratt Free Lib., Baltimore</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Illustrated and Annotated New Testament for Catholics</h2><p>The Illustrated and Annotated New Testament for Catholics contains the complete text of the New Testament in the most authoritative Catholic translation, th New American Bible, Revised Edition (NABRE), published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

Rooted in phenomenology and incarnational theology, the book gives primary focus to the body as it considers the prayer offices and the liturgical calendar, sacrifices and sacraments, initiation and vestments, ritual theory and play, word and meal, fasting and feasting, penance and celebration, rites of passage, cultural perspectives, and the role of art, music, dance, and drama in worship. The author invites readers to return to the experience of their own body through guided yogic exercises. As a text for students and liturgical practitioners, the volume gives fresh voice to the experience and practice of worship as bodily acts. <i>Embodied Liturgy</i> is a dynamic, accessible new resource in liturgical and sacramental theology from one of the premiere scholars in the field. Frank C. Senn distills an established legacy of expertise in an innovative and inviting perspective on bodily acts of worship.</p><p>Frank C. Senn is a retired Lutheran pastor and visiting professor.

While three columns of British soldiers and their African allies cross the uMzinyathi River to commence the invasion of the Zulu Kingdom, a handful of redcoats from B Company, 2/24th Regiment are left to guard the centre column&#x2019;s supply depot at Rorke's Drift.On the morning of 22 January, the main camp at Isandlwana, just ten miles to the east, comes under attack from the entire Zulu army and is utterly destroyed. Four thousand warriors from King Cetshwayo&#x2019;s elite Undi Corps remained in reserve and were denied any chance to take part in the fighting. Led by Prince Dabulamanzi, they disobey the king&#x2019;s orders and cross into British Natal, seeking their share in triumph and spoils. They soon converge on Rorke&#x2019;s Drift; an easy prize, with its paltry force of 150 redcoats to be readily swept aside.Upon hearing of the disaster at Isandlwana, and with retreat impossible, the tiny British garrison readies to receive the coming onslaught. Leading them is Lieutenant John Chard, a newly-arrived engineer officer with no actual combat experience. Aiding him is B Company&#x2019;s previously undistinguished officer commanding, Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, along with 24-year old Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne, and a retired soldier-turned civilian volunteer named James Dalton.Unbeknownst to either the British or the Zulus, half of the centre column, under Lord Chelmsford&#x2019;s direct command, was not even at Isandlwana, but fifteen miles further east, at Mangeni Falls. However, with a huge Zulu force of over twenty-thousand warriors between them and the drift, their ammunition and ration stores taken or destroyed, and an impossible distance to cover, Chelmsford&#x2019;s battered column cannot possibly come to the depot&#x2019;s aid, and must look to their own survival. The defenders of Rorke&#x2019;s Drift stand alone.</p><p></p><h2>Digging a Hole to Heaven: Coal Miner Boys</h2><p>At 12 years old, Conall has already worked in the coal mines of West Virginia for two years. He spends his days deep underground with his faithful mule, Angel, carting loads of coal back and forth between the coal seams and the main shaft, where elevators take the coal up to the surface. One day a tunnel collapses, and his brother is trapped with others on the wrong side! How can Conall and Angel help to save them?Mixing archival images with his original artwork, in this historical fiction picture book acclaimed author and illustrator S. D. Nelson gives voice to the poverty, grueling labor, and dangerous conditions experienced by child laborers across our nation in the past, echoing conditions today, especially for migrant fieldworkers.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Digging a Hole to Heaven</i></b><br> "Nelson&#x2019;s acrylic-paint illustrations are gritty and realistic; more evocative still are the historical photographs that appear on nearly every page. A useful and thorough piece of work combining fiction and nonfiction, with an extensive author&#x2019;s note detailing the history of coal mining."<br> --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>S. D. Nelson is a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the Dakotas. He is the award-winning author and illustrator of numerous children&#x2019;s books. He lives in Flagstaff, Arizona.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;This illustrated title explores 19th-century coal mines, combining features of both historical fiction and informational texts. The book brings readers into the world of fictional Conall, a 12-year-old coal miner. Mines employed boys as young as eight to separate coal from useless rock or to run beside rolling coal cars and jam sprags (thick sticks) into the wheels to stop them (the cars had no brakes.) The work was dark, dirty, and dangerous. Preteens worked as mule drivers, trapper boys, and spraggers. Daily life underground is depicted through Conall's story: his work, his family, and his role in a heroic rescue after a cave-in. The narrative comes alive with colorful descriptions, such as stout timbers that groan and a "massive mountain...forever leaning in upon itself." Beautiful textured paintings rendered in the style of 19th-century Plains Indian drawings, with acrylic on wood panels, accompany the narrative. Numerous sidebars and archival photographs ground the story in the real world. A comprehensive author's note adds context with information about the Industrial Revolution, child labor, mining disasters, and the future of coal in the global environment. The back matter adds further depth. Consider pairing this title with Michael Burgan's Breaker Boys: How a Photograph Helped End Child Labor (Compass Point, 2011) or Kashmira Sheth's compelling Boys Without Names (S. &amp; S., 2010), a first-person narrative about child sweatshop workers in modern India. A strong, vivid look at child labor issues.&#x2014;Toby Rajput, National Louis University, Skokie, IL</p><h2>The Silver Donkey</h2><p><b>"At once delicately told and deeply resonant. . . . This tender fable of peace will linger with both younger and older readers." &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;(starred review)</b><br><br>One morning in the woods of World War I France, two young sisters stumble upon an astonishing find &#x2014; a soldier, temporarily blinded by war, who has walked away from battle longing to see his gravely ill younger brother. Soon the care of the soldier becomes the girls&#x2019; preoccupation, but it&#x2019;s not just the secret they share that emboldens them to steal food and other comforting items for the man. They are fascinated by what he holds in his hand &#x2014; a tiny silver donkey. As the girls and their brother devise a plan for the soldier&#x2019;s safe passage home, he repays them by telling four wondrous tales about the humble donkey &#x2014; from the legend of Bethlehem to a myth of India, from a story of rescue in war to a tale of a family close to the soldier&#x2019;s heart.

Who's there?"<br><br>He looked toward Marcelle and Coco and must have seen two skinny, flash-eyed little girls, wild as kittens born under stables, the taller dressed in her brother's hand-me-downs, the smaller rumpled as a street urchin - but then he looked to the moldery soil and up into the trees, and behind himself toward the distant sea. . . . He scrambled backward in the dirt, covering his knees in mud. "Who is there?" he asked again.<br><br>Marcelle and Coco stared. . . . "It's just us," said Marcelle. "No one else."<br><br>The man stopped scrabbling and became very still. . . . "I can't see you," he said nervously. "I'm blind. Who are you?"<br><br>. . . The girls, emboldened, peered more closely at their discovery, stepping from the shadows like fawns. They saw that the man had untidy brown hair and that his face was rather dirty. Coco, who had a sparrow's quick eyes, saw that he held something silver and enticing in his palm, something that twinkled and gleamed. . . . "I'm Marcelle," she told him. "I'm ten. This is my sister, Coco. She's eight. Her real name is Th�r�se, but everybody calls her Coco." <br><br>. . . "Are you a soldier?" asked Coco unexpectedly.<br><br>The man hunkered against the tree. "Why do you ask that?"<br><br>"Well, you are a bit like a solider. You have a soldier's blanket and a soldiers' boots. And once there were soldiers who slept a night in our village and they spoke in a funny way, the same way you do."<br><br>"It's called an accent," said Marcelle with superiority.<br><br>The man was fidgeting, casting his blind gaze about. The fascinating silver thing remained closed in his hand, gleamy as a fishhook, hidden as a jewel. He said, "I am a solider - well, I used to be.

It is a tense and surprising story, filled with indecisive bureaucrats, uninformed leaders, hotheaded politicians, and dedicated and honorable soldiers on both sides. <br><br>The six-month-long agony that began with Lincoln's election in November sputtered from one crisis to the next until Lincoln's inauguration, and finally exploded as the soldiers at Sumter neared starvation. At the center of this dramatic narrative is the heroic figure of Major Robert Anderson, a soldier whose experience had taught him above all that war is the poorest form of policy. With little help from Washington, D.C., Anderson almost single-handedly forestalled the beginning of the war until he finally had no choice but to fight. <br><br>David Detzer's decade-long research illuminates the passions that led to the fighting, the sober reflections of the man who restrained its outbreak, and individuals on both sides who changed American history. No other historian has given us a clearer or more intimate picture of the human drama of Fort Sumter.<br></p><p>So vividly does <i>Allegiance</i> re-create the events leading to the firing of the first shot of the Civil War on April 12, 1861, that we can feel the fabric of the Union tearing apart.

The Chronicler finds in the records of Israel the &#34;great overall pattern&#34; of God&#39;s hand in history. The Lord&#39;s constant mercy, love and faithfulness shine through. With great perception, the Chronicler first selects and then proclaims this vibrant pattern, highlighted in the living events of the nations&#39;s actual hsitory. Once its purpose is grasped, the book comes alive. It can be seen as nothing less than a final and momentous look back over the entire Old Testament. Viewed in this way, Chronicles has something of the vividness, contrast and drama of the last book of the New Testament, Revelation. Michael Wilcock sees the countless persons named and chronicled as part of one people of the living God. They make vivid to us the truths by which the Lord&#39;s people in every generation are to live.</p><p>Wilcock was formerly director of pastoral studies at Trinity College, Bristol. He has now also retired from many years of pastoring churches in the United Kingdom, most recently St. Nicholas&#39; Church, Durham.</p><h2>Stories from the St. Louis Cemeteries of New Orleans (Landmarks)</h2><p>The tombs and graves of the St. Louis Cemeteries rise from the ground, creating labyrinthine memorials aptly dubbed &#34;cities of the dead.&#34; Most are in even rows with quaint street names. Some are of crumbling brick and broken marble. Others are miniature mansions clad in decorative ironwork with angelic guardians. Grand or humble, each is a relic of the story of New Orleans. Politicians, pirates, Mardi Gras Indian chiefs and one voodoo queen rest below. In an unprecedented inquiry, author Sally Asher reveals the lives within the mysterious and majestic tombs of the St. Louis Cemeteries.</p><p>Sally Asher is a writer and photographer living in New Orleans. A frequent contributor to Louisiana Cultural Vistas, she regularly lectures on New Orleans history though the Louisiana State Museum. Her photography appears in local, national and international media outlets including Newsweek, U.S. World News and New Orleans magazine. An original Big Easy Rollergirl (retired), Asher is a proud co-captain of New Orleans&#39;s Leijorettes, a marching krewe honoring Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan.</p><h2>Rebel Style: Cinematic Heros of the 1950s</h2><p>Between the end of World War II and the election of John F. Kennedy there was a tremendous shift in Hollywood film: a fresh wave of actors (with Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Paul Newman, and James Dean) whose talent and lives seemed to be inseparable in their work, came to the forefront of film-making. This Rebel style brought a completely new attitude and look to the screen. The leather jacket and provocative stare of a Brando, and the prole clothes and the broodingly cool demeanor of a Clift became the aesthetic correlative of an American version of the existentialist view of life. G. Bruce Boyer analyzes the sartorial and philosophical revolution brought about by the representatives of this first counterculture, and the evolution of the Rebel style.<br></p><p></p><h2>The Second World War: Europe and the Mediterrean Atlas (The West Point Military History Series)</h2><p>From the prewar development of the German war machine to the ultimate victory of the Allied coalition, here is an in-depth analysis of the battles that raged on the Western and Eastern Fronts. It examines the major strategies, the innovative tactics, and the new generation of weapons&#x2015;along with the people who used them.</p><p>These titles were developed and written by the faculty of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Weaving the complexities of individual historical conflicts into a broader perspective, these books chronicle the turbulent periods of civilization. Utilizing their expertise as scholars and soldiers, the authors shed light on the crucial events and factors that shaped the execution of the world&#x2019;s great military campaigns. Photographs, illustrations, and maps of the campaigns&#x2015;thoroughly researched for historical accuracy&#x2015;are either included in the books or available as companion atlases. Each volume focuses on a specific era of warfare, bringing you into the thick of battle with a clear and accurate picture of men at war.<p>"Excellent...the strength of the books is in the operational military history, and they present well-argued evaluations of the wars' commanders and campaigns."&nbsp; </p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)</p><h2>Doomed Bourgeois in Love : Essays on the Films of Whit Stillman</h2><p>Critics have praised the films of writer-director Whit Stillman for their exceptionally intelligent portrayal of the lives and loves of the urban haute bourgeoisie. His three comedies of manners -- Metropolitan, Barcelona, and The Last Days of Disco -- sparkle with urbane and ironic wit. In Doomed Bourgeois in Love, the cultural critic Mark C. Henrie brings together a collection of political theorists, literary critics, and classicists to explore the meaning of Stillman&#39;s films.</p><p>Doomed. Bourgeois. In Love. With those words, used in advertising copy to promote his first film, Academy Award-nominated writer-director Whit Stillman debuted his peculiar comic genius. At once class-conscious, theory-laden, nostalgically romantic, and deflatingly ironic, Stillman has charmed thousands (though he doubtless hoped for millions) of viewers. His three comedies of manners--Metropolitan, Barcelona, and The Last Days of Disco--sparkle with urbane and ironic wit. But they also betray the presence of a profound social commentary. Themselves charmed, and therefore intrigued, by Stillman&#39;s art, the writers gath-ered here by Mark C. Henrie have each applied their consid-erable critical intelligences in an effort to uncover the political, social, and religious purposes so cleverly hidden in the comedy. These essays contend that Stillman&#39;s art is an effort to &#34;ironize&#34; our ironic age; as such, they constitute a major achievement of Christian humanism in our time. &#34;Anyone who enjoys Whit Stillman&#39;s movies--which really ought to be everyone, East Side, West Side, Uptown, Downtown--will be grateful for this thoughtful and highly readable collection of essays on his art and inner meanings.&#34;--Christopher Buckley, author of Wry Martinis and Thank You for Smoking &#34;One often hears literate people sigh, &#39;Why are movies today so awful? What happened to dialogue, to manners, to moral depth?&#39; Then along came Whit Stillman, whose movie Metropolitan instantly demonstrated that, against all odds, it was still possible to make movies that were both serious and fun, mannerly and full of life. Barcelona and The Last Days of Disco confirmed the triumph. Whit Stillman is already a national treasure. This fine collection of essays, as wide-ranging as they are well written, does what the best criticism always does: whets one&#39;s appetite for Whit. This is a book to be read in daylight hours; in the evening, you will want to watch and rewatch the films of a young American master.&#34;--Roger Kimball, The New Criterion &#34;Stillman is the Balzac of the ironic class, the Dickens of people with too much inner life.&#34;--Stephen Hunter, The Washington Post &#34;If F. Scott Fitzgerald were to return to life, he would feel at home in a Whit Stillman movie. Stillman listens to how people talk, and knows what it reveals about them. His characters have been supplied by their Ivy League schools with the techniques but not the subjects of intelligent conversation, and so they discuss &#34;The Lady and the Tramp&#34; with the kind of self-congratulatory earnestness that French students would reserve for Marx and Freud.&#34;--Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times"The contributors...have a great many shrewd and illuminating things to say about Stillman and his art..." -- <i>National Review</i></p><h2>Wasps (Blastoff!

Despite a degree in economics from a major American college, his strong accent has barred him from the corporate world. Forced to eke out a living as a cab driver, he is unable to manage the emotional and material needs of a temperamental African American bride and a widowed mother demanding financial support. When he turns to gambling, his mounting losses compound his woes.<br><br>And so he travels back to Nigeria to steal the statue, where he has to deal with old friends, family, and a mounting conflict between those in the village who worship the deity, and those who practice Christianity. <br><br>A meditation on the dreams, promises and frustrations of the immigrant life in America; the nature and impact of religious conflicts; an examination of the ways in which modern culture creates or heightens infatuation with the "exotic," including the desire to own strange objects and hanker after ineffable illusions; and an exploration of the shifting nature of memory, <i>Foreign Gods</i> is a brilliant work of fiction that illuminates our globally interconnected world like no other.</p><p>Okey Ndibe first came to the US to take up appointment as the founding editor of&nbsp;<i>African Commentary,&nbsp;</i>a magazine published by Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe. He has been a visiting professor at Brown University, Connecticut College, Simon&#x2019;s Rock College, Trinity College, and the University of Lagos (as a Fulbright scholar). His award-winning journalism has appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Guardian</i>, and the&nbsp;<i>Hartford Courant</i>, where he served on the editorial board.

He&nbsp;lives in West Hartford, CT, with his wife, Sheri, and their three children.<b>Chapter One</b><br>&nbsp;<br> Ikechukwu Uzondu, &#x201c;Ike for short,&#x201d; parked his Lincoln Continental cab at a garage that charged twelve dollars per hour. Before shutting off the engine, he looked at the car&#x2019;s electronic clock. Nine forty-seven a.m.; it meant the gallery would have been open for a little less than an hour. <i>Perfect, </i>Ike thought, for he wished to be done transacting his business before the place started buzzing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He walked a block and a half to 19 Vance Street. Had a small animal been wedged in his throat, his heart could not have pounded more violently.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eave over the door bore a sign etched in black over a bluish background: foreign gods, incorporated. It was written in tiny, stylized lettering, as if intended to create a tactful anonymity. Few would stumble upon a store like this; it would be found, it seemed, only by habitu�s and devotees. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the street was a bar. Ike contemplated a quick drink or two to calm his nerves. How odd to flack for a war god while jittery.<br> Yet, to go in smelling of alcohol might also be a costly mistake.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gallery door clicked, and a tanned woman walked out. A squat carved statue was clutched close to her breast, held in asuckling posture. At the curb, a gleaming black BMW pulled up. She opened the rear door and leaned in, arched backside revealing the outline of her underwear. Her black high-heeled shoes were riveted with nodes of diamond. She strapped the deity in place with the seat belt and then straightened. The car&#x2019;s front door was opened from inside. She lowered herself in, and the car sped off.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ike pulled at the gallery door&#x2014;surprisingly light. A wide, sprawling space unfurled itself: gray marble floors, turquoise walls, and glass-paneled showcases. A multitude of soft, recessed lights accentuated the gallery&#x2019;s dim, spectral atmosphere. In the middle of the room, slightly to the left of the door, a spiral staircase with two grille-work banisters rose to an upper floor. Ike knew from the <i>New York </i>magazine piece that people went upstairs only by invitation. And that those invitations went only to a small circle of long-term collectors or their designated dealers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an otherworldly chill in the air. There was also a smell about the place, unsettling and hard to name. Ike froze at the edge of the run of stairs that led down to the floor of the gallery. From the elevation, he commanded a view. The space was busy but not cluttered. Clusters of short, squat showcases were interspersed with long and deep ones. Here and there, some customers peered into the glass cases or pored over catalogs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a matter of two, three weeks, his people&#x2019;s ancient deity, Ngene, would be here, too. And it would enjoy pride of place, not on this floor, with the all-comers and nondescripts, but upstairs, in the section called Heaven. Ngene was a majestic god with a rich legend and history. How many other gods could boast of dooming Walter Stanton, that famed English missionary whose name, in the syllable-stretching mouths of the people of Utonki, became<i> Su-tantee-ny</i>?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thought gave him a gutsy boost. He trotted down the steps to the floor of the gallery. Walking unhurriedly, he cast deliberate glances about him, so that an observer might mistake him for a veteran player in the rare sport where gods and sacred curios were bought and sold. He paused near the spiral staircase. A sign warned please do not ascend unless escorted. He walked on to a chesthigh showcase. A hefty wooden head stared at him from atop a rectangular stump. The face was pitched forward, like a tortoise&#x2019;s head poking out of a shell. On closer inspection, Ike saw that the carved head was deformed by a chipped, flattened nose and large, bulgy eyes. Inside the case, four fluorescent puck lights washed the statue with crisscross patterns of luminescence and shadows. A fork-tongued serpent coiled itself round the statue&#x2019;s neck.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an electronic key code for the showcase&#x2019;s twin-winged door, and several perforations in the glass, small and circular, as if designed to let in and let out just enough air to keep the glum, rigid statue from suffocating. A strip tag glued to the glass cage identified the deity as C1760. Ike picked up a glossy catalog and thumbed to the C section. Each page was columned, with sections marked &#x201c;inventory code,&#x201d; &#x201c;name,&#x201d; &#x201c;brief history,&#x201d; and &#x201c;price.&#x201d; He ran his finger down the line until he saw the tag number. Then he drew his finger across to the price column: $29,655.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He flipped the pages to the catalog&#x2019;s last section, marked &#x201c;Heavenly Inventory.&#x201d; The lowest price in the section was $171,455; the highest $1.13 million. He studied the image of one of the deities in that section. Carved from soot-black wood, it had two fused figures, one female, and the other male. The figures backed each other. The female was big breasted and boasted a swollen belly. The male figure held a hoe in one hand, a gun in the other, its grotesque phallus extending all the way to its feet. They shared the same androgynous head, turned neither left nor right but forward. A pair of deep-set eyes seemed to return Ike&#x2019;s stare. It was listed for $325,630. Ike read the short italicized description: <i>A god of the crossroads, originally from Papua New Guinea.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Wait until they see Ngene,&#x201d; he said under his breath, a flush of excitement washing over him. Surely, a legendary god of war would command a higher price than a two-faced crossroads idler.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the thought, the catalog slipped from his hands and thudded on the floor. He hastily picked it up, glancing all around. Perhaps the gallery&#x2019;s surveillance camera was beamed on him, trailing his every movement?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He moved to another showcase. He squatted, bit his lip, and peered intensely at the encased quarry, nodding like a connoisseur. From nowhere some foul whiff brushed his nose and he recoiled.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard a woman&#x2019;s low voice and stood to look, but two showcases blocked his view.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Have I ever&#x2014;ever&#x2014;been too busy for you?&#x201d; a man answered in a stentorian voice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pair of sequined magenta shoes descended the staircase. These yielded toned calves, then sturdy thighs that disappeared beneath a tight purplish skirt, and then the tanned, tight upper body of a blonde. Then, behind her, the man appeared.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ike recognized Mark Gruels, the owner of the gallery. He did not panic, his poise a remarkable feat, considering what was at stake. Neither the woman nor Gruels looked Ike&#x2019;s way. Her right arm was around his waist, his left arm draped over her shoulder. They circled the staircase and walked down another aisle, toward the far wall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ike watched them but pretended to be riveted by the catalog. Gruels was a head taller than the woman, even though she looked at least five nine. Cerise pearls adorned the woman&#x2019;s neck. Gruels&#x2019;s groomed appearance seemed to leave some room for cultivated ruggedness. He had a full head of black hair, garnished with dots of gray. He wore a dark green down vest over a bleached green shirt, one sleeve rolled up to the elbow, the other left unrolled.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gruels and the woman spoke inaudibly for a moment, entranced by the same object: a mammoth, snout-faced statue in a showcase.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So?&#x201d; the woman finally asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gruels swayed side to side, as if in deep thought. Then he shook his head doubtfully.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not that one,&#x201d; he said in the tone of a man accustomed to confident judgments. His voice was deep, even a little gravelly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking at a goddess. She&#x2019;s definitely not a good fit. Not for you. You do better with strong male gods. You&#x2019;d find her&#x2014;shall I say&#x2014;a bit too feisty. Too cranky.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s quite the cutie,&#x201d; the woman said, leaning into Gruels.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No question, but she&#x2019;s not your type. Trust me.&#x201d; He pressed her closer to him. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want a goddess that clashes with your personality. Plus, it doesn&#x2019;t jibe with your other acquisitions.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s actually not for me. I&#x2019;d like something amazing for my brother. And this should do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Birthday?&#x201d; Gruels asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s never been big on birthdays. He&#x2019;s just having a tough time rebounding.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Has he been sick?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, divorced.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Josh?&#x201d; Gruels sounded incredulous.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, darling&#x2014;you know I have only the one brother.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He and Heather parted ways?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, Mark, have you been living in a cave again?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, really,&#x201d; said Gruels. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned sideways and rested her body against his. Gruels rubbed and kneaded her shoulders. Ike felt a tug in the crotch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She related how Heather had run away with another woman, leaving Josh crushed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Gruels said, &#x201c;A man dumped by his wife for another woman deserves some spectacular gift. You can&#x2019;t get better than this.&#x201d; He glanced up at the deity. &#x201c;This, here, is a Mayan marvel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And what are you asking for her?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Twenty thousand&#x2014;eighteen thousand for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sir, can I help you with anything?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ike turned, startled. A petite woman stood behind him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How may I help you?&#x201d; she asked again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her nose was pierced midridge with a toothpick-sized coppery crossbar. Her head was shaved close to the scalp. A whorl of tattoos ran all over her arms and neck.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I came to see&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mark?&#x201d; she interjected.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mr. Gruels,&#x201d; he said. Despite all his years in America, he&#x2019;d never become comfortable with the idea of calling strangers by their given name. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes lit up. &#x201c;Did you call two days ago?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Three. Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I recognized that accent!&#x201d; Ike stiffened at the word &#x201c;accent,&#x201d; and his eyes blazed. Oblivious, she continued: &#x201c;Listen, Mark&#x2019;s busy with a customer right now. You can wait for him right here. Unless it&#x2019;s something I can help you with. My name is Stacy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait,&#x201d; he said, still vexed by that reference to his accent. He turned and nearly bumped into Gruels. The gallery owner held the blond with one hand, the Mayan deity with the other.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mark, this gentleman wants to see you,&#x201d; Stacy announced.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Letting go of the blond&#x2019;s hand, Gruels seemed to whirl round to Ike.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You want to see me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Not in everybody&#x2019;s presence, </i>Ike thought<i>. </i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait until you finish. With her.&#x201d; He pointed at the blond.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gruels smirked and then retook the woman&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Until I finish with her? What makes you think I want to <i>ever </i>be finished with her?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gruels laughed, and the woman followed suit, her head thrown back. Gruels whispered into her ear, released her, and circled back to Ike. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m listening,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ike&#x2019;s tongue felt coated. Why didn&#x2019;t Gruels invite him to an<br> office or some secluded corner?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gruels folded his arms. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I have&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, you have what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A business proposal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gruels slapped both hands, bemused. &#x201c;You want to invest in my business? Great! How much are we talking here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ike gave a short, awkward chuckle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a busy morning for me,&#x201d; Gruels said. &#x201c;Business proposal. You&#x2019;ve got to spell out what you mean. And you&#x2019;ve got to do it quick.&#x201d; He glanced at his wristwatch. &#x201c;I have a meeting to run to&#x2014;in, like, <i>now! </i>So?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I have a god I can bring,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You have a god?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Great. Let&#x2019;s see it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m traveling to bring it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the point of this discussion?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ike swallowed hard. &#x201c;I want you to buy it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Buy what? I can&#x2019;t buy what doesn&#x2019;t exist.&#x201d; Gruels glanced at Stacy, who tightened her lips and shrugged.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It exists,&#x201d; Ike cried, his voice close to combative. Then, checking<br> himself, he added, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a powerful deity, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gruels regarded him with intense eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t buy stories; I buy <i>things. </i>You see what I mean?&#x201d; He glanced at his watch again and turned sharply sideways, as if to walk away. Instead, he tarried and addressed Ike. &#x201c;Bottom line, you have nothing to show me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In less than three weeks, I will have it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So why are we holding this discussion <i>now</i>? Why don&#x2019;t we have it in three weeks&#x2014;or whenever you&#x2019;ve got something to show?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ike said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a god of war.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It could be a god of shit for all I care.&#x201d; Gruels paused, his eyes danced, taking in Ike with curious interest. He put a left hand on Ike&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to insult you. That&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m about.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It used to lead our people to war,&#x201d; Ike explained, determined to capitalize on the indirect apology.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s great,&#x201d; Gruels said, his tone flavored anew with sarcasm. &#x201c;Great for your people.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts tossed about in Ike&#x2019;s mind. He foraged for the magic words that would kindle the other&#x2019;s interest. He saw Gruels&#x2019;s lips quiver, about to speak. Anxiety overcame him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Trust me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a very, very ancient deity. A very powerful god.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So you say. Great! Nobody ever sold me a shitty god. And nobody ever bought one from me. Every god I ever bought or sold had the greatest mojo in all of time. So, what&#x2019;s new?&#x201d; He took another look at his watch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How much are you willing to pay for it?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gruels scratched his forehead and then gazed at Ike, silent.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Trust me,&#x201d; Ike said, unable to bear the silent exchange of stares.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;...</p><h2>The Best of Steppenwolf</h2><p>(Guitar Recorded Versions). 20 classic rock hits: Born to Be Wild * Desperation * Don&#39;t Step on the Grass, Sam * Give Me News I Can Use * Hey Lawdy Mama * Magic Carpet Ride * Monster * Who Needs Ya * and more.

Air Force Lt. Col. (Ret) Bob Reneau began writing this story as his autobiography for his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and succeeding generations. However, he was convinced by many friends to turn it into book form for anyone. Bob has spent twenty-five years as an Air Force pilot. He was an original AC-130 pilot in Laos and Vietnam in 1968 and 1969. As an Airlifter flying the C-130, Bob was stationed and flew out of Sewart AFB, Tennessee, Evreux AB in France, Naha AB; Okinawa (now Japan), and Patrick AFB, Florida, where he flew Gemini Space Mission support. He was on top of all but one splashdown as telemetry and voice relay. Bob was also stationed at Ubon AB, Thailand, Rhein-Main, Germany, and Pope AFB, North Carolina. He flew all over Europe, Southeast Asia, North Africa, South Africa, Australia, and the United States. He has flown around the world two times, He was also a Reconnaissance and Special Operations pilot, logging over 8000 flying hours. He has served in most of the major air commands. His medals include the Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, twelve Air Medals, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry (individual award), and many other awards and decorations. Bob hopes to leave more information for his progeny than his father did. Although he talked freely to his sons about his war experiences, Bob&#x2019;s father neglected to mention them in his limited biography. He served as an unarmed chaplain during WWII. He went ashore onto Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion where his landing craft was blown out from under him. He made it onto the beach on a floating pontoon and served through many famous battles including the Battle of the Bulge, The Ardennes Forest and others. This is Bob&#x2019;s interesting, funny, poignant, and informative story.</p><p></p><h2>Freedom for Ministry</h2><p>Taking a look at today&#39;s Church and religious situation, Neuhaus argues that there is a necessary awkwardness about Christian ministry because we are ambassadors of a &#34;disputed sovereignty&#34;.

They provide political education and sites for constituent engagement, and they are beginning to create networks across issues and/or communities; they promote home-grown leadership among groups that have been disadvantaged; they contribute to a shared understanding of the problems of inequality and injustice; and they offer a public space for the dialogue needed to identify common principles."&#x2015;From the Ground UpFrom community organizing for affordable housing in neglected neighborhoods to providing antiviolence training for youth or litigating for the rights of sex workers, grassroots organizations are engaged in energetic efforts to increase the power of marginalized groups. Social-change organizations operate in communities all over the United States, but little has been written about the details of their operations.From the Ground Up takes a close look at how social-change organizations address challenges related to leadership, staff development, decision-making, resource needs, and collaborations. Carol Chetkovich and Frances Kunreuther, both experienced nonprofit managers, draw on their in-depth interviews with leaders and staff members from sixteen diverse social-change organizations to provide a detailed analysis of these groups and their activities. They note that even working in isolation, these organizations make important contributions to justice in their communities; together they might form the base of a larger progressive movement for change.</p></p><p>"The growing number of local and regional social change-oriented groups in the country have had a major impact in improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who are low income and at the margins of our society. Their activities have not only provided essential services but also enabled formerly voiceless citizens and noncitizens to become civically engaged and involved in the political process. But we haven't known much about who they are, how they function, and how they relate to larger, national organizations. From the Ground Up by Carol Chetkovich and Frances Kunreuther is a must-read for all of us who are interested in grassroots efforts, anti-poverty strategies, and social movements. The authors have done an admirable job of mobilizing data and pinpointing trends, yet they have not hesitated to express their own views about what it will take to sustain and strengthen these social change organizations. Their book is a job well done."--Pablo Eisenberg, Georgetown University, author of Challenges for Nonprofits and Philanthropy: The Courage to Change <p> "From the Ground Up is an immensely readable exploration of the largely unexplored relationships among grassroots organizations, social movements, and systemic social change. Carol Chetkovich and Frances Kunreuther do something rarely seen: they combine a thorough summary of pertinent academic literature with the testimony of practitioners to give activists and academics alike a helpful and thoughtful book."--Kim Klein, founder of Grassroots Fundraising Journal and author of Fundraising for Social Change </p><p> "Carol Chetkovich and Frances Kunreuther view social change organizations as an important feature of today's sociopolitical landscape that is too often overlooked. Drawing from information about sixteen small nonprofit organizations in a variety of service realms whose goals include systemic/structural social change, the authors analyze the goals, structure, and challenges of such organizations. From the Ground Up will appeal to a wide audience, including nonprofit and foundation practitioners and scholars, social workers, sociologists, and political scientists."--Nancy Jurik, Arizona State University, author of Bootstrap Dreams: U.S. Microenterprise Development in an Era of Welfare Reform</p>Carol Chetkovich is Associate Professor of Public Policy and Director of the Public Policy Program at Mills College.

C and Sam leave the home their father built for a new beginning, and find fortune building a lucrative business called the Associates &#x2014; but when a rash of deaths has the townspeople looking at C and Sam as suspects, they find their father's legacy reaches further than they expect.

First published in 1935 and virtually unavailable for years, this extraordinary novel tells the story of a young American--the unnamed narrator--who hitchhikes his way across Asia, from Beirut to China, living off the land and depending on the hospitality of the people he meets along the road. As Pico Iyer writes in the introduction, "[Prokosch] catches the peculiar logic that makes travel a land of alternative reality, a foreign state in itself that is an intoxication."</p><p><p><b>Frederic Prokosch</b> (1908-89) was a distinguished American poet and novelist of the 1930s and 1940s.

He conveys a fatalistic sense of life half hidden beneath a rich animal energy. He is a master of moods and undertones, a virtuoso in the feeling of place, and he writes in a style of supple elegance.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Albert Camus</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Asiatics</i> is original in its conception, beautiful in its execution.

From setting the boat on fire not once, but several times in the Aegean Sea to his not-so-grand arrival in Spetses to meet the owners of the boat (who says it isn&#x2019;t graceful to plow into the docks as a means of coming to a stop?), Stewart quickly catches the sailing bug. <br><br>By the end of the summer, as he is facing the dreary prospect of going back to sheep shearing, he jumps at the chance to be part of a crew to follow Viking Leif Eiriksson&#x2019;s historic journey across the Atlantic Ocean. From coming to terms with the long, cold nights at sea and unchanging cuisine to battling intense seasickness and managing to go to the bathroom during a massive storm (a lot harder than you&#x2019;d think!), Stewart keeps his good humor, but learns, in the end, that perhaps the best things in life are worth coming ashore for.</p><p><b>Chris Stewart</b> is the author of <i>Driving Over Lemons</i>, which became an international bestseller, along with its sequels, <i>A Parrot in the Pepper Tree</i> and<i> The Almond Blossom Appreciation Society</i>. In an earlier life, Chris was the original drummer in Genesis (he played on the first album), then joined a circus, learned how to shear sheep, went to China to write the Rough Guide, gained a pilot&#x2019;s license in Los Angeles, and completed a course in French cooking.Chapter 1<br>Teach Yourself Sailing<br><br>It was Julie Miller who sent me to sea, one wet autumn afternoon in London&#x2019;s Wandsworth Road. Now of course you haven&#x2019;t a clue who Julie Miller is, and indeed why should you . . . but her relevance to this episode and subsequent adventures is that she had a great-aunt called Jane Joyce.<br><br>&#x201c;Chris!&#x201d; yelled Julie, who was more than a match for the thundering of London traffic. &#x201c;What a fantastic coincidence. I&#x2019;ve been longing to see you and there is something I particularly wanted to ask you . . . what was it now? Ah yes, how would you like a job looking after a yacht in the Greek Islands this summer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like that very much,&#x201d; I replied, without so much as a thought. &#x201c;As it happens I&#x2019;m not too busy this summer.&#x201d; Which was the long and the short of it, for at the tender age of twenty-nine my career as a sheep farmer had just hit the skids. The bank had refused any further loans to nurture the flock that my girlfriend, Ana, and I were tending on rented land in Sussex, and my &#x201c;prospects&#x201d; as my mother insisted on calling them, were not looking overly bright.<br><br>&#x201c;Terrific,&#x201d; said Julie. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a very great relief. My great-aunt Jane has been on at me for weeks to find her a skipper, and I thought of you straightaway.&#x201d;<br><br>Now this, it must be said, was a most peculiar thing for her to think. For I had never been on a boat before in my life, and I knew not the first thing about sailing. But I desperately wanted a job, so it struck me that it might be best to keep minor details like my complete and utter unsuitability for the job to myself.<br>clearly, the first thing to do was to bone up on boating, in order to conduct myself satisfactorily at the interview. So I bought Teach Yourself Sailing or some such guide and immersed myself in it. It was not, I thought, quite as gripping as a book on such an interesting subject ought to be, and I emerged from it with only the haziest notions of sailing and how it was done. If I had the pictures in front of me, I could tell the difference between a sloop (gaff-rigged or Bermuda), a schooner, a ketch, and a yawl; I had a very vague idea what beating and tacking and running were; I had learned the undesirability of jibing when running; and I could tell you more or less when to reef, or if things cut up really rough, to scandalize.<br><br>I did a little work on the vocabulary, too. I discovered that ropes were not actually ropes, but sheets, lines, halyards, warps, painters, stays, or ratlines. The toilet was not the dunny but the heads. Of course, the front wasn&#x2019;t the front and the back wasn&#x2019;t the back. . . . Then there was a fid and the bitts and take-alls, there were peaks, luffs, and clews; and if you didn&#x2019;t feel too good, you could always heave to.<br><br>Friends and family were concerned about my cavalier attitude and horribly obvious ignorance. &#x201c;What if you<br><br>tip the old bird into the drink?&#x201d; they asked. &#x201c;How would you live with yourself if you were to wreck the boat, or, worse still, drown the lot of them and yourself into the bargain?&#x201d;<br><br>I pointed out the tautology, reassured them that things would turn out for the best, and dialed the number of<br><br>my patron-to-be. A pleasingly patrician American voice answered.<br><br>&#x201c;But my dear, I have been simply longing for you to ring. Dear Julie has told me all about you and I simply cannot wait to meet you in the flesh, so to speak. However, things being as they are, I suppose I shall have to. So perhaps next Tuesday evening at eight o&#x2019;clock would suit you?&#x201d;<br><br>I returned my nose to the sailing book and tested myself one more time on vocabulary&#x2014;full and by, jibing, reaching, tacking . . . goose wing, veering, backing. Then, got up like a dog&#x2019;s dinner&#x2014;I think I even wore a tie&#x2014;<br><br>I rang the bell at two minutes to eight at a very opulent brick apartment block on the intimidatingly elegant south side of Cadogan Square. A tall, slightly stooped octogenarian opened the door. He had thick white hair and a bulbous nose and spoke quietly in a voice that was full of slowness and gentleness.<br><br>&#x201c;Why, you must be Chris.&#x201d; He offered me his hand, which I shook as firmly as I thought proper for one so frail. &#x201c;Welcome. Come in. I&#x2019;m Bob Joyce, but please call me Bob. Jane will be down shortly. In the meantime, perhaps you&#x2019;d care for a drink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a whisky and soda,&#x201d; I replied. It seemed the right drink for a captain, though I can&#x2019;t remember ordering the drink by choice on any other occasion.<br><br>&#x201c;Very sensible, too. Ice?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Er, yes, please.&#x201d;<br><br>Bob busied himself at the drinks cabinet. I took stock of my surroundings&#x2014;immense but rather gloomy opulence.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;re right, it is a little on the tenebrous side, but we&#x2019;ve only taken it for a few months&#x2014;and at least it&#x2019;s warm.&#x201d;<br><br>Funny . . . I hadn&#x2019;t said anything.<br><br>&#x201c;Here, have a seat, Chris. I believe you&#x2019;re to be our skipper this summer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s right, or, rather, I hope so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I hope so, too, Chris. Cheers. It&#x2019;s no good talking to me about boats though; I hate the damn things. The boat is my wife&#x2019;s hobby.&#x201d;<br><br>A rustle of expensive materials, a scent of gardenias, and Jane was down.<br><br>&#x201c;Chris, how good of you to come. I am charmed to meet you. Now, Bobby, have you given our skipper a drink? Yes, good, I see you have. Please sit down.&#x201d;<br><br>Jane was a whirlwind of a woman, getting on for seventy, I supposed, but still quite a beauty, and with an air of ease and power. I fumbled for something nautical to say, but, hell, we didn&#x2019;t want to get into all that stuff about heads and bitts just yet. Jane was running the show, anyway. Bob sipped his whisky and drummed his fingers on his knee.<br><br>Jane poured herself a drink and sat down opposite me, looking at me keenly as she made her assessment.<br><br>&#x201c;Chris, I feel sure we shall get along wonderfully well; your references are impeccable. I won&#x2019;t even tell you all the glorious things that dear Julie said about you&#x2014;and Julie is a person whose opinions I take very seriously. Now, I imagine you know all there is to know about sailing, so we needn&#x2019;t bother ourselves with that . . . &#x201d;<br><br>At one stroke Jane had removed the rope with which I might have hanged myself, but like an idiot I failed to take advantage of it. My brain was still in sailing mode, and instead of casting about for some subject about which I actually knew something, I was desperately trying to come up with something that would give Jane the impression that I was a nautical sort of a person.<br><br>&#x201c;Is . . . is she a gaffer?&#x201d; I spluttered.<br><br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon, my dear?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean the boat, the yacht . . . is she a gaffer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is she a what?&#x2019; Her face took on a rather pained expression.<br><br>&#x201c;A gaffer&#x2014;you know, gaff-rigged . . . &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t the faintest idea, Chris. Does it matter?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No&#x2014;no, not at all, just curiosity. I&#x2019;d sort of like to know what manner of boat I&#x2019;ll be sailing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll tell you what I&#x2019;ll do. I&#x2019;ll send you the brochure and everything else, all the details, before you come.&#x201d;<br><br>This was a piece of cake, like taking candy from a baby. Bob poured me another whisky while Jane filled me in on my duties. My pay would be fifty pounds a week plus a living allowance. I would collect the boat from where it was moored at a marina near Athens and sail it down to the island of Spetses, and there we would spend the summer. I would start in May, to get the boat ready for the Joyces&#x2019; arrival. Jane, in spite of the apparent grace of her carriage, was about to undergo a double hip transplant. The summer sailing season would start as soon as she recovered from the operation.<br><br>And that was that. I had passed the interview&#x2014;albeit as the only applicant . . . which, thinking about it, is really my preferred sort of interview. All of a sudden I was a Greek island yacht skipper, with a bigger pay packet than I&#x2019;d ever had before, and a long summer of sunshine and sailing before me. My ship, you might say, had come in.<br><br>I skipped ecstatically across Battersea Bridge, to where I was staying with my sister. And as I skipped, the first shadows of doubt began to form. From what I had seen of these Joyces, I liked them; and they were family to some cherished friends of mine. I didn&#x2019;t want to let any of them down. Perhaps my critics were right, and it was time I started to take this business a little more seriously.<br><br>When I returned to Sussex, I took Ana to our local pub and told her about my amazing good fortune. Now, as luck would have it, there was, drinking in the pub at the time, an acquaintance of ours called Keith, who had for some months been trying to worm his way into the favors of Ana. I remember him as a rather malodorous person with a black beard, a boyish, chubby face, and not the remotest snowball in hell&#x2019;s chance of making it with my woman, because&#x2014;apart from anything else&#x2014;he was too damn tight even to buy a round of drinks.<br><br>I was crowing to him about my exciting windfall when he stopped me and said: &#x201c;It so happens that I&#x2019;ve just bought my first boat. She&#x2019;s moored at Littlehampton and I don&#x2019;t have a car, so if you drive me down to the boat, I&#x2019;ll give you a sailing lesson.&#x201d;<br><br>We cemented the pact with a beer . . . which I bought.<br><br>This Way, Then That<br><br>A few days later, on a bone-chilling misty April morning, I found myself on the dock at Littlehampton, watching while Keith buggered about with what appeared to me meaningless and boring preparations for the forthcoming voyage. His boat was a bit of a disappointment, too&#x2014;a grotty little twenty-one-foot craft banged together out of plywood and tin. It had the advantage, though, he told me, of being extremely cheap. She was called, whether coincidentally or not, Ana, and this set me to wondering just what sort of hideous designs Keith had on my girlfriend. Still, you don&#x2019;t look a gift horse in the mouth . . . and you certainly didn&#x2019;t want to look Keith in the mouth; his halitosis, poor boy, could drop a man at fifty feet. He worked for the Department of Health and Social Security.<br><br>After an eternity of fidgeting about with ropes and a bucket, Keith started the outboard motor. Pibble pibble ibble obble ibble obble, it went. We slipped the mooring lines and pottered out into the river, then down past the pier and out into the high sea. I stood half frozen by the mast, thinking of Odysseus leaving Ithaca, and trying to look important and knowledgable.<br><br>Two minutes after passing the head of the pier we were surrounded by mist. I forgot Odysseus and started to think of the Ancient Mariner. This, then, must be the sea, I thought. It was calm, with just a faintly disagreeable heaving about it, and you couldn&#x2019;t see a thing. I shivered. Keith turned the engine off, which was a blessing as the sound it made was extremely irritating. Silence . . . apart from the slop of the waves against the side of the boat, and the drip, drip of the water condensing on the rigging.<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said Keith excitedly. &#x201c;Time to get the sails up.&#x201d;<br><br>I went below, where, confined in a tiny and evil-smelling space it was even more unpleasant than above, and passed the sails out to Keith. Then, with a mild feeling of nausea I helped him unfold them and fix them to the various shackles and stays. This was good, as it engaged me in meaningful occupation for a minute or two. We hoisted the sails, made fast their ropes, and, with Keith taking the tiller, sat back to watch what happened.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re sailing!&#x201d; cried Keith, beside himself with excitement. I couldn&#x2019;t see it myself; as far as I could gather we were just bobbing up and down in a great wet white bowl of nothingness. It was chilly and damp and I was thinking to myself that perhaps I had made a terrible mistake, because if this was sailing, then I didn&#x2019;t like it, not one little bit.<br><br>&#x201c;Look, we&#x2019;re actually making headway, we&#x2019;re bowling along,&#x201d; shouted Keith in an excess of misplaced euphoria. I licked my finger and held it up to see if I could detect any breeze, cat&#x2019;s paw, zephyr, or other sign of movement. Nothing. He pulled the tiller over and shouted the words, &#x201c;Ready about . . . LEE HO!&#x201d; I stared at him incredulously. What sort of thing was that for one sensible adult to shout at another?<br><br>The boom swung gently toward us. It seemed we were supposed to duck under it and shuffle onto the other side of the cockpit, keeping the ropes in hand as we went. The boat apparently swung round but, although we were now ostensibly facing a different direction, nothing else seemed to have changed. Actually, it was impossible to be sure where you were facing, as the closeness of the thick white fog had a peculiarly disorientating effect. I no longer knew where the shore was, even though it couldn&#x2019;t have been as much as a hundred yards off.<br><br>We ate our cheese and tomato sandwiches in silence, more as a way of relieving the monotony than because we were hungry. In a desultory fashion I read bits of my book about sailing, but if the truth be told, I was going off the whole thing fast. For most of that long, gloomy April day we went bobbing first this way, then that, in the middle of nowhere. Occasionally we would drag a finger in the water to see if we could perceive any sign of movement. The fog sat heavy on the sea and refused to lift. From somewhere came the mournful whooing of a foghorn buoy and the halfhearted clank of a bell. This was just about as depressing as a thing could be.<br><br>Finally Keith, too, decided that he&#x2019;d had enough. He started the engine and we turned to where he reckoned the pier was. We were actually a fair way off; I suppose the tide must have taken us. The fog lifted just a little bit, and we could see in the distance the pier that ran out from the mouth of the river. Slowly, unbelievably slowly, we approached it. I could hardly believe how slow our progress was. It took us the best part of an hour to cover what must have been less than a quarter of a mile, and the closer we got to it, the slower our rate of approach seemed to be. As we puttered beyond the lighthouse on the end of the breakwater, an ordinary garden snail could have given us a run for our money.</p><h2>The Raid: A Dramatic Retelling of Ireland&#39;s Epic Tale (Ulster Cycle, 1)</h2><p><p>Queen Maeve has declared war upon the province of Ulster in an effort to take possession of the Brown Bull of Cooley. Ultimately, this is an attempt to match the wealth of her husband, King Ailill of Connacht, who owns a magnificent white bull. Only Cuchulainn, a boy warrior, stands between Ulster and certain annihilation. Supported by the Morrigan, the goddess of war, he begins a reign of terror upon the Connacht warriors. In his heroic stand, the reader discovers the genesis of the determination of the Irish people, their will to stand alone against oppression.</p></p><p><b>Randy Lee Eickhoff</b> writes novels, plays, poetry and translations in several languages.

In the comfortable rubble of their bedclothes Ailill nestled his head, damp from fervent lovemaking, upon Maeve's lap, admiring her naked breasts above him. <br>"It is true, my love, what they say about things being good for a woman if she is the wife of a wealthy man," Ailill boasted. He moved his heavy shoulders, twisting them to crush the sharp quill of a feather that poked him through the cushion he lay upon. He reached up and tweaked the nipples of her breasts, admiring how they leaped out for his attention. Maeve's breath quickened. Her lips touched his briefly, and he tasted honey on the tantalizing flicker of her tongue. <br>"Perhaps," Maeve answered. "But what made you think of that at a time like this?" <br>She lazily twined her long fingers through the thick hair of his chest, tugging gently. He pushed a heavy curl of her thick red hair away from her cheek and caressed it with the backs of his fingers. <br>"It just struck me how much better off you are today than the day I married you," Ailill said. "Far more fortunate with me than you were with your other husbands, Conchobar Mac Nessa, Tinne Mac Connrach, and Eochaid D�la." <br>"I was well enough off without you," Maeve said arrogantly, slapping him lightly upon the forehead. He grinned and tweaked her breast again. Her eyes became heavy, her pale skin blushing rosily beneath its alabaster, her red lips curling up toward her high cheekbones. Her long, flowing hair glowed golden-red in the pale light emanating from the guttering candles in sconces upon the polished wood of the walls and she swung it forward, brushing it lightly over his naked flesh. <br>"Then you must have kept your wealth well hidden," Ailill said huskily. "Your neighbors had made off with all of your plunder--except for the things that a woman has that are hers alone--before I came to your father's house to seek your hand. Your father was grateful, indeed, that I would bring my wealth and my armies into his family. Of course," he added slyly, caressing the roundness of her hip with his palm, "I found the prize well worth my trouble--even though there were other women with far richer dowries begging for my bed." <br>Maeve sat up, her eyes flashing with anger, her breasts heaving indignantly. <br>"Then you should have taken them for your wife!" she snapped. She slapped his hands away when he tried to caress her. "And what do you mean by suggesting I was a beggarly mist-wanderer? No! My treasure room bulged with riches. You forget that I had the High King of Ireland for my father: Eochaid Feidlech the Steadfast, the son of Finn, the son of Finnoman, the son of Finnen, the son of Finngoll, the son of Roth, the son of Rig�on, the son of Blathacht, the son of Beothacht, the son of Enna Agnech, the son of Aengus Turbech. My father had six daughters: Derbriu, Ethne, Ele, Clothru, Muguin, and myself, Maeve, who became the greatest of all. None were as graceful, more generous than I! I could easily defeat them in battle for I knew more about war than they. And my beauty drew men to my side as a candle flame draws a moth. My court dwarfed theirs: fifteen hundred soldiers served me, drawing their wages from my war chest. All were the sons of Exiles, and the same number of freeborn Irishmen. For every mercenary in my service, I had fifty-five others, and that was only my ordinary household." <br>She drew a deep breath, eyeing him arrogantly. "My father recognized my worth and gave me a whole province including this one that I ruled from Cruachain. That is why some call me Maeve of Cruachain. Many kings sent their sons to woo me. One came from Finn, the king of Leinster, Rus Ruad's son. And from Coirpre Niafer, the king of Temair, another of Rus Ruad's sons. The son of Conchobar, king of Ulster, son of Fachtna, came and others came from Eochaid Bec. But none could win my hand for I asked a harder wedding gift from them than had been asked by any other woman in Ireland: whosoever claimed my hand would never display meanness or jealousy or fear. <br>"I knew what I was doing, Ailill, for if I married a mean man, our union would most certainly fail. I am too full of grace and giving for one man. It would be an insult to my husband to have a wife more generous than he, but not if both were equal. Likewise, it would not do for a wife to be more spirited than her husband and I need a man my equal in temper. Nor could my husband be jealous for I have never slept with one man without another waiting in the shadows to take his place. <br>"That is why I chose you, Ailill, for you are not niggardly, jealous, or afraid. But apparently you have forgotten that I brought with me the highest wedding gift a bride has ever brought her husband: enough garments to clothe a dozen men, a chariot easily worth three times the price of seven serving maids, enough red gold to cover the width of your face and the equal of the weight of your left arm in white gold." She drew a deep breath, fondly slapping his hands away from her. "But this does not mean that you should feel as if you are a kept man. I would not have chosen you had you not been my equal. And if one has taunted you, saying that it is your wife who is the more important one in the marriage bed, you should ignore him," Maeve said patronizingly. "The one who would be insulted is me for suggesting I would settle for an inferior." <br>Ailill laughed and leaned back upon the cushions, moving away from another quill's stab. <br>"In this you are very wrong," he said. "I am a king's son and I have two kings for brothers: Cairpre in Temair and Finn in Leinster. They rule only because they are older than myself. Neither is better than I in grace or giving. The reason why I came here to claim your hand, Maeve, is not because you were wealthy, but because I had never heard in all of Ireland of a province being ruled by a woman. Now, I rule this province as the successor to my mother, Mata Muires, M�gach's daughter. You are my queen because who would be better than a daughter of the High King of Ireland? Not because of your wealth. And as for your generosity, well, Maeve, all know you enjoy men between your legs, drinking the honey-mead from your lips. As many as thirty a night!" <br>"You can make all the claims that you wish," Maeve answered haughtily. "But the fact remains that my wealth is far greater than yours." <br>"How delightful," Ailill said, laughing and shaking his head. "Surely you jest! No one owns more property than I or more jewels and riches. This is fact. I know it." <br>Maeve's lips thinned, her eyes glinting like gray ice. She leaned back away from his questing hands, her heavy breasts swinging tautly away, rosy nipples defiant. "Then," she purred, "let's have an accounting to see who is the richer." <br>"I think," Ailill said, laughing again, "you are making too much of this. But if you really want to do this, then we will. But later," he said coaxing, rolling his eyes up, the blue dancing with tiny lights. <br>For a moment, she resisted, then she caught her breath as his hands brought a rosy flush to her skin. "One night won't make any difference," Maeve relented, smiling roguishly at him. <br>And so, on the next day, they began with the challenge. Orders went out among the many rooms of the hall and servants scurried back and forth through the kitchens and the corn kiln and buttery, the ale-brewing house, the baking house, through the storage sheds and the guest houses, tripping over the rushes on the floor of the great hall, gathering the belongings of Ailill and Maeve. Servants first brought out the lowliest of their possessions: buckets and tubs, iron pots, washbasins, and ewers and drinking vessels, but all were found to be equal. Next came servants with caskets containing their rings for both fingers and thumbs, bracelets, and intricately carved gold brooches and pins mounted by fine jewels, followed by servants staggering under armloads of clothing dyed in solid colors: crimson, saffron, purple, blue, black, green, yellow, and plain gray. These were followed by clothing dyed in various colors: brown-yellow, checked, and striped. Shepherds brought folds of sheep in from the fields, their wool heavy and unshorn, and meadows and plains to be counted and matched and paired to be certain that they were of equal size. All, however, decided one to be equal to the other. Even Maeve's prize ram, worth the price of one bondmaid himself, was matched by another belonging to Ailill. <br>Next, their herds of horses and teams were led in from paddock and pasture. Maeve's finest stallion was easily matched by another from Ailill's herds. Then swineherders scoured the woods and gullies and refuse piles and drove in vast herds of pigs, but all were found equal. Maeve had a fine boar, but Ailill had another easily his equal. Finally, herdsmen rounded up their cattle from the woods and wastelands of the province and brought them in to be matched and measured, and they too were found to be of the same size and numbers with one exception: a great bull in Ailill's herd that had once been a calf of one of Maeve's cows. His name was Findbennach, the White Bull, and so proud was he that he refused to belong to a herd owned by a woman and moved in with Ailill's herd. Maeve ordered her herdsmen to search for his equal among her herds, but their search was in vain, and Maeve's spirits fell into black melancholia as if she had not a single brass bracelet. <br>She had the messenger Mac Roth, a masterful maker of suggestions, called to her chambers and ordered him to find the match of Findbennach even if he had to search out every province in Ireland. Mac Roth, however, already knew where the equal of Findbennach lived. <br>"In the province of Ulster, in Cuailnge's territory, in the house of D�ire Mac Fiachna, lives the bull called Donn Cuailnge, the Brown Bull of Cooley," he said. "This bull is easily the equa...</p><h2>The Writings of Christine de Pizan</h2><p><p><strong>A compilation of the great 15th century French writer, Christine de Pizan's most important works rendered into English by major scholars and translators.

The resulting book is both an acute portrait of a village and an intimate account of her struggles to adapt to a different way of life. Like the best cultural travel narratives<i>, In the Circle of the Dance </i>draws on the author's experiences to illuminate both exterior and interior worlds.</p><p>Bjork's book is in many ways a primer on the realities of fieldwork, from setting up house to participating in the work of the village women to finding ways to communicate across cultural divides. It describes how this outsider achieved a gradual and provisional inclusion in the community, an inclusion represented by her participation in a traditional women's circle dance. The book also depicts the effects of modernization and tourism on a society that remained closed to the West well into this century, while offering comparative insights about wider South Asian cultures.</p><p>The author's lyrical, frequently moving descriptions of everyday life guide her readers through the stages of her cultural apprenticeship. In the end, as Bjork joins the circle dance, she is a stranger to the community still, but a familiar and welcome one.</p></p><p><p>Katharine Bjork Guneratne lives in St. Paul.

But there is unadulterated joy in <i>Reptile House</i>, and it lies in the inventiveness of McLean&#x2019;s language. Her prose is energetic and lyrical without excising ugliness . . . This skill with language makes possible the stories&#x2019; portraits of human beings, so revealing in their unsentimental bleakness, and it is in this unique style that the worldhood of <i>Reptile House</i> emerges. . . . To read <i>Reptile House</i> is to dwell in a broken, funny, frightening, possibly doomed world a world that may help us to read and live in our own."<br><br> <b><i>Kenyon Review</i></b><br><br>"Characters struggle to control slivers of their fates in the nine stories of McLean&#x2019;s debut. . . .

[She] stages yearning and stasis with poignancy and wit."<br><br><b> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>"McLean&#x2019;s debut collection of short stories moves seamlessly from adultery to kidnapping, from assassination plots to extreme geothermal events, all in a voice that is spare and darkly poetic. . . . McLean&#x2019;s characters are lonely in their marriages, isolated from the world around them, and not generally given happy endings. What this book does offer, however, is strangely realistic glimpses into conflicts that are equal parts surreal and hyper-realistic, rendered by a voice that gracefully juxtaposes terse reportage and lyrical insight. The result is a taut volume that explores the fate of the dashed dreamer, offering charming insights into the untidy worlds of people who are not where they thought they&#x2019;d be."<br><br> <b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>"I am still thinking about these stories, still turning those objects over in my head like the strange but stunning artifacts of someone else&#x2019;s life.

Her characters are carried along by those cascades, often unwittingly. Sometimes, as with the two young men in 'No Name Creek,' they are carried to a happy end. More often, they seem to be, like Lilibeth in 'Cold Snap,' overtaken by events beyond their control. Characters&#x2019; own words, often inept or pathetic in light of their situations, offer ironic counterpoint. Much is laughable in these stories. Don&#x2019;t be deceived. Through her sly wit and humor, Robin McLean is luring readers into deeper questions.&#x201d;<br><br><b> Frank Soos</b><br><br> Tonally and structurally, these marvelous stories have no discernable influences.

Kissing cousins to George Saunders, Donald Barthelme, and perhaps even Don DeLillo, they are nonetheless powered by a distinctive new voice. McLean dives fearlessly through the Looking Glass; she scrubs the psyche raw, perhaps in an effort to get even closer to what constitutes 'reality'."<br><br><b> Jim Story</b><br><br>"Robin McLean's debut collection is electric.

Her relaxing idyll is interrupted when a librarian, Gwen Richmond, is crushed to death beneath collapsed bookshelves. After the &#x201c;accident&#x201d; proves to be murder, Mrs. Malory&#x2019;s godson Tony, who also works in the library, asks her to help investigate. Gwen was manipulative and unpleasant, so there are no shortage of suspects. The dead woman&#x2019;s World War II diary reveal dreadful truths that may lead to the killer; they will also force Mrs. Malory to revisit the past in a new and colder light. The Cruellest Month is the second of Hazel Holt&#x2019;s Mrs. Malory mysteries.</p><p>Hazel Holt has many devoted fans in the United States and Great Britain as a writer of &#34;cozy&#34; British mysteries; she has published nineteen Mrs. Malory novels at last count. She is also known to admirers of Barbara Pym as the friend and biographer who additionally edited Pym&#39;s posthumous works.Bland Sheila Malory (the widow heroine of Mrs. Malory Investigates) settles her son in at Oxford, then retires to the Bodleian Library, arguably the nicest setting a mystery could have, to research an article on little-known Victorian authors. Her godson Tony, a shy Bodleian staffer, is helpful but fretful: it was he who, a short while back, discovered irascible Gwen Richmond dead in the stacks. The police deemed it an accident, but Tony has found two clues--and with them the dull, naive Mrs. Malory begins delving. She learns that Gwen was hated by many and may have been blackmailing some, including Tony's financially overwhelmed sweetheart; an elderly scholar from Harvard; and the inimitable Fitz, a don under whose spell Sheila and her youthful love Rupert fell years ago as undergraduates. Whodunit? Certainly not the author, who is, correctly, more interested in Bodleian accoutrements, Oxford byways, and bittersweet remembrances of romance. Not as complicated as the author may have intended, but one of the world's great libraries is always worth a visit. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Employing global economic manipulation, Carroll financed the sending of manned spaceship the <i>Clarke</i> on a suicide mission to investigate. Blades told the world about the extraterrestrials and the <i>Clarke-</i>but the resulting chaos, exploited behind the scenes by a still-scheming Carroll, led to World War III. Meanwhile, the <i>Clarke</i> made first contact, but the aliens' statements and motives proved cryptic. Here the crew of the now-disabled vessel discovers an asteroid on a collision course with Earth and tries desperately to send home a warning, but the aliens are preventing all outside communication. Meanwhile, war rages on Earth and the extent of Carroll's plans becomes chillingly clear. Heavy drama, high stakes, mystery and intrigue abound-not least surrounding the baby Astra, conceived and secretly born in space aboard the <i>Clarke</i>, whose intelligence is developing much faster than normal. <b>VERDICT</b> A very strong entry in the current for-mature-readers sf trend.

The author, foremost poet and thinker of the Jewish Middle Ages, offers clear and usable delineations of the religion of Israel. In the easy style of a Platonic dialogue, he presents first a critique of Christianity and Islam, and then explores the nature of Israel's first religious faculty, the question of the "chosen" people, the implications of a "minority religion." Against those who accommodate to prevailing philosophical trends, Judah Halevi is blunt, frank and uncompromising in his discourse on the central teachings of Judaism: revelation, prophecy, the laws, the Holy Land, and the role of the Jewish people as spokesman for religious faith.</p><p>Judah Halevi (born circa 1080) is the greatest poet and one of the profoundest thinkers Judaism has had since the closing of the canon. He plumbed the depths in religion and reflection on history, and he made claims for Israel so strange and inordinate, that he would be merely an anomaly unless profoundly related to his time and viewed centrally from that history and destiny in which he was rooted and of which he is clearly the deepest expression and interpretation. The overshadowing event of his time was the struggle of Christian and Moslem for Spain; and, farther afield, the mastery of the Holy Land. In Spain, the community of Israel was ground between upper and nether millstones; and in Palestine, the last spark of hope seemed finally extinguished with the advent of the Crusaders. Israel appeared to be doomed. Judah Halevi's poetry and prose are the response evoked by that world situation.<br>--from the Introduction by Henry Slonimsky"We can still learn much from Judah Halevi... his serene allegiance to history and the long-range forces of destiny high above the immediate brute realities and implacable forces of nature. His exposition of powerlessness as a superior counterpart to the forces of state supremacy..."<br>--Salo Baron<br><br>"In defending Judaism... against the philosophers, he was conscious of defending morality itself and therewith the cause, not only of Judaism, but of mankind at large."<br>--Leo Strauss</p><h2>The 5 Languages of Appreciation in the Workplace: Empowering Organizations by Encouraging People</h2><p><b>Is appreciation communicated regularly at your workplace?&nbsp;Do you truly feel valued by those with whom you work?</b><br><br>If you express appreciation in ways that aren&#x2019;t meaningful to your coworkers, they may not feel valued at all.

A setting of his strongly autobiographical text, this is a revealing self-portrait of a young man.

But what does this mean? In The Right's Road to Serfdom, first-time author Christopher F. Arndt unpacks the riddle. The conservatism that drives the American Right today prizes strong, authoritarian leaders who promise get-tough plans to vanquish problems such as immigration, terrorism, and middle-class stagnation. This focus on temperament rather than on individual liberty, pluralism, and free expression runs counter to the political philosophy of freedom that many conservatives believe they espouse. With the aid of F. A. Hayek, a surprising conservative critic, Arndt reveals four qualities that animate the American Right. These characteristics, which tend against political freedom, are often misunderstood and promoted as political freedom. Arndt calls the promotion of this misconception the "freedom fraud." He offers a Rosetta Stone for the American Right, a valuable guide to contemporary conservative actions and a clear explanation of how the "Party of Liberty" ended up with Donald Trump as its standard-bearer in 2016.</p></p><p>Christopher Arndt&#39;s first career was as an Equity Analyst and a Partner at Select Equity Group, Inc., a New York-based asset management firm. After contributing to the significant growth of the firm, he left in 2010 to focus on public policy issues, such as accelerating the adoption of clean energy. He was the Director of the New York Chapter of Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) and currently serves on the board of the NRDC Action Fund. Mr. Arndt attended Wesleyan University from which he graduated with honors from the College of Social Studies concentrating in economics, history and political theory. He now lives in Telluride, Colorado with his wife Patty and his two children, Alden and Graham. The Right&#39;s Road to Serfdom is his first book.&#34;This short, thoughtful book is a great contribution to our understanding of the American ideal of Liberty, how that ideal is perverted by powerful special interests to let their influence creep in, and how and where a healthy role for government is required for true political freedom.&#34; -- Senator Sheldon Whitehouse &#34;Arndt presents a fascinating and extremely timely discussion of political freedom, the American Right, and our politics at large. Increasingly, the priorities of the American Right are at odds with the very freedom they claim to advocate. This scholarly, yet readable book bares the secret hypocrisy that&#39;s sadly co-opted the Right and polluted political discourse.&#34; -- Congressman Jared Polis, CO-2nd District &#34;At least for environmentalists, the odd thing about conservatives in recent decades has been their lack of interest in conservation, their willingness to let the physical world change in radical ways. This insightful and interesting book helps explain that conundrum.&#34; -- Bill McKibben, author Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet</p><h2>The Simple Life: Plain Living and High Thinking in American Culture</h2><p><p>Our current less-is-more impulse may have contemporary trappings, says David E. Shi, but the underlying ideal has been around for centuries. From Puritans and Quakers to Boy Scouts and hippies, our quest for the simple life is an enduring, complex tradition in American culture. Looking across more than three centuries of want and prosperity, war and peace, Shi introduces a rich cast of practitioners and proponents of the simple life, among them Thomas Jefferson, Henry David Thoreau, Jane Addams, Scott and Helen Nearing, and Jimmy Carter.</p><p>In the diversity of their aspirations and failings, Shi finds that nothing is simple about our mercurial devotion to the ideal of plain living and high thinking. "Difficult choices are the price of simplicity," he writes in the book's revised epilogue. We may hedge a bit in the practice of simple living, and now and then we are driven by motives no deeper than nostalgia. Shi stresses, however, that the diverse efforts to avoid anxious social striving and compulsive materialism have been essential to the nation's spiritual health.</p></p><p>DAVID E.

Rick returns from the war with his body broken and his dreams shattered. But it was not just body and spirit he sacrificed for the war. He and Francesca volunteered their beloved dog, Pax, for the Army's K-9 Corp, not knowing if they'd ever see him again.</p><p>Keller Nicholson is the soldier who fought the war with Pax by his side, and the two have the kind of profound bond that can only be forged in war. Pax is the closest Keller has to a sense of family, and he can't bear the thought of returning him to the Stantons. But Rick and Francesca refuse to give him up. Instead, an arrangement is made: Keller will work as Rick's live-in aide. And thus an unlikely family is formed, with steadfast Pax at the center. As they try to build a new life out of the ashes, Keller and Francesca struggle to ignore their growing attraction to each other, and Rick, believing that he can no longer give Francesca what she needs and wants, quietly plans a way out. </p><br><p>All three of them need healing.

He&#x2019;s in an alley, a brick wall conveniently placed, so that he conducts his business in privacy. Today was the last day of play for the Waterbury Comets, and Frederick &#x201c;Rick&#x201d; Stanton has just spilled his good news to his teammates. Despite the C-league Comets&#x2019; losing season, he&#x2019;s pitched well, and in the spring he&#x2019;ll report to the minor-league AA team, the Hartford Bees. It was surprisingly hard to say, and he was a little embarrassed to have gotten choked up, especially when they all raised their beer mugs and toasted his good luck. <br>He&#x2019;s finally going to be able to say good-bye to cobbled-together amateur teams, and all his years of hard work, from sand lot to high school to playing in college, have paid off. Sacrificing steady employment in a respectable profession like his father&#x2019;s, banking or accounting, in favor of menial jobs he has no compunction about leaving when practice starts up has been worth it. <br>Still, he&#x2019;ll miss these guys, the oldest among them the catcher, &#x201c;Foggy&#x201d; Phil Dexter; the youngest, a kid of sixteen who cheerfully takes all their good-natured abuse, lugging most of the equipment, always riding stuck between two bigger players, fetching for the rest of them, and enduring persistent razzing about the state of his virginity. <br>Finishing up, Rick feels the first drops of rain on his bare head. Those few drops are quickly followed by a complete cloudburst, but he stays where he is. It&#x2019;s hot inside, and the cool rain feels good. Rick raises his face to the sky and opens his mouth, taking in the taste of fresh rain. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the luckiest man on earth,&#x201d; he says to the sky, and in that moment, he&#x2019;s pretty certain that he is. Well, he should get back in. Eat another couple sandwiches, toss back one more beer; laugh at a few more tired jokes. The season is over and no curfew tonight. <br>Thoroughly soaked now, Rick turns around and trips over something, nearly pitching headlong onto the brick pavers. That something yelps. <br>It&#x2019;s a puppy, and rather than running away after being tripped over, it stays put, and for a hard moment, Rick thinks he may have accidentally killed it with his big feet. In the weak light of the open back door, Rick sees the glint of life in its eyes. &#x201c;Whoa, fella. Where&#x2019;d you come from?&#x201d; Rick squats down and the wet and trembling puppy inserts itself between his knees as if seeking shelter. It sits and rests its muzzle on Rick&#x2019;s leg. As quickly as the cloudburst started, it fades away, the rivulets trickling down the side of the wall, pooling in the interstices between the bricks. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;re your people, little guy?&#x201d; <br>The puppy shakes, spraying Rick with a thousand droplets. Rick scoops it up and heads back into the tavern. In the light, he can see it&#x2019;s a boy, silvery in color, with a darker saddle across narrow shoulders and along ribs that poke out like the bones of a chicken. His ears flop over at entirely different angles, as if they belong to two different puppies. Probably a German shepherd, or at least mostly shepherd. The bartender doesn&#x2019;t say anything when Rick comes in carrying a puppy, so Rick holds him up. &#x201c;He yours?&#x201d; The barkeep shakes his head no. <br>The barkeep&#x2019;s wife swings a new pitcher onto the table and considers the dog on Rick&#x2019;s lap. &#x201c;Probably got dumped out back. You found him, you keep him. Don&#x2019;t leave him here.&#x201d; <br>The puppy has settled neatly on Rick&#x2019;s lap, gently taking the bits of meat Rick offers without nipping those important fingers with his sharp teeth. He can&#x2019;t keep a dog; he&#x2019;s living in a boardinghouse. In nine months, he&#x2019;ll be at training camp. In a year, with luck, he&#x2019;ll be pitching for the majors. <br>&#x201c;Got to name him if you&#x2019;re keeping him.&#x201d; Dan Lister, their manager, spreads a gob of mustard on his third corned beef sandwich. &#x201c;How &#x2019;bout Spot?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Too common. Besides, he doesn&#x2019;t seem to have any spots, and who said anything about me keeping him?&#x201d; Rick fingers another tiny bite of sandwich into the puppy&#x2019;s mouth. <br>&#x201c;Lucky.&#x201d; Foggy has slumped in his chair, so that his chin is barely above the edge of the table. <br>&#x201c;Well, he is a lucky dog if one of you bums keeps him.&#x201d; Rick holds the wriggling fur ball up as if offering the puppy for auction. <br>&#x201c;Darby?&#x201d; This from the kid. <br>&#x201c;Darby?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I had a dog named Darby. My dad&#x2019;s Irish. It&#x2019;s how they say Derby over there. Darby was a real good dog, never left my father&#x2019;s side all the time he was sick with tuberculosis. We even let him come to the funeral.&#x201d; <br>The group grows silent. No one had known that the kid was a half orphan. <br>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll call him Rin Tin Tin. He looks like he might be shepherd.&#x201d; Rick scratches the puppy under the chin. &#x201c;What do you think? You gonna grow up to be some kind of movie star hero dog?&#x201d; The puppy yawns, drops his head, and is instantly asleep. Rick realizes what he&#x2019;s just said. If he names this puppy, how will he ever drop him back in the alley? It&#x2019;s not even fair to keep the dog on his lap, to allow the little thing to accept a few minutes of comfort, let him think that humans are trustworthy. The party will break up soon, and what then? Abandon the tyke to the elements? His first trust in humans to do right by him destroyed, and maybe he&#x2019;ll never trust another human being again. Rick can feel the puppy&#x2019;s beating heart in the palm of his pitching hand. The fluff of baby fur feels like the softest mink of his mother&#x2019;s fur stole as Rick strokes him, lifting the spatula-shaped paws and feeling the thick bones of a puppy with the potential to become a large dog. If he&#x2019;s not hit by a car or starved to death. <br>Dan Lister pushes away from the table. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done in. Go to bed, gentlemen. I bid you farewell. Keep healthy and see you&#x201d;&#x2014;he looks at Rick&#x2014;&#x201c;most of you, in the spring.&#x201d; The manager presses both hands on the table, suggesting that he&#x2019;s more sober than he is. <br>The bartender hands Rick a length of string for a leash, but Rick carries the ten pounds of soft fur in his arms. Foggy is bumbling into chairs and tables while trying to find the front door. &#x201c;Come on, Phil, throw an arm over my shoulder.&#x201d; <br>Foggy Phil Dexter gladly slings his arm over Rick&#x2019;s neck and leans into him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be great. Bees need a good curveball pitcher.&#x201d; His breath is rank with beer and pastrami, but Rick doesn&#x2019;t mind. Phil&#x2019;s been a good friend and taught him a lot about the game. &#x201c;By God, you&#x2019;ll be in the majors in a year.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your mouth to God&#x2019;s ear.&#x201d; Rick bears the weight of the man and the small burden of the puppy as they walk the few blocks to their boardinghouse. <br>Everything that he&#x2019;s done has been fed by his lifelong ambition to play for the majors. Rick has never wanted anything else in his life. As a kid, he asked Santa for gloves and balls and bats; as a teen, he paid his own way to baseball camp, using the money he earned from a paper route. He never learned to sail, letting his father practically adopt the next-door neighbor&#x2019;s kid to crew for him. Tomorrow, he&#x2019;ll head down to his parents&#x2019; Greenwich home. He wonders if, when he gives them his good news, his extraordinary and long-awaited news, they&#x2019;ll finally respond with some pride and enthusiasm. <br>The puppy in his hand wriggles himself up and under Rick&#x2019;s chin. Well, so what if they don&#x2019;t. He&#x2019;s a grown man, he&#x2019;s stuck to his plan, and now, at very nearly the last minute, at age twenty-seven, he&#x2019;s finally there. Almost. He doesn&#x2019;t want to be the world&#x2019;s oldest rookie when he finally gets the call to major-league baseball. <br>Maybe this will be the last winter keeping fit by any means possible while substitute teaching or doing temporary work at a busy accounting firm. In eight months, he&#x2019;ll be back in training, a hardball in his hand, sensitive fingers feeling for the seams, the magic of that perfect throw. The future spools out in front of him: a winning season with the minor-league Bees, then getting the call to the majors. His first appearance in the National League. Rick sees himself doffing his ball cap and waving at cheering fans. He&#x2019;s paid his dues, by God. Forfeited job security and Mary Ann Koble, who didn&#x2019;t want to be a ballplayer&#x2019;s wife. <br>The puppy yawns, burrows his tail end deeper into the crook of Rick&#x2019;s arm. Why not keep him? He could be a mascot. A lucky charm. A companion on all those miles of roadwork. <br>There is a church along the way, more beautiful than any other building on this defeated main street; its all-white marble facade glows softly in the newly rain-freshened air. Picked out in gold leaf on the pediment are Latin words: <i>Gloriam Deo Pax In Terra</i>. <br>&#x201c;Pax. Peace.&#x201d; Rick looks at the puppy in his arms, now sleeping with utter trust in the man carrying him. It&#x2019;s started raining again, a warm drizzle that makes the wet pavement shimmer beneath the sparse streetlamps. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the luckiest man on earth.&#x201d; <br> <i>Pax.</i> The puppy in Rick&#x2019;s arms suddenly wakes. He reaches up with his baby muzzle and his long pink tongue comes out to lick Rick&#x2019;s nose.

Because of her business acumen, commitment to her players, and larger-than-life personality, she would leave an indelible mark not only on baseball but also on American history. Attending her first owners&#x2019; meeting in 1937, Manley delivered an unflattering assessment of the league, prompting Pittsburgh Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee to tell Abe, &#x201c;Keep your wife at home.&#x201d; Abe, however, was not convinced, nor was Manley deterred. Like Greenlee, some players thought her too aggressive and inflexible. Others adored her. Regardless of their opinions, she dedicated herself to empowering them on and off the field. She meted out discipline, advice, and support in the form of raises, loans, job recommendations, and Christmas packages, and she even knocked heads with Branch Rickey, Bill Veeck, and Jackie Robinson. &nbsp;Not only a story of Manley&#x2019;s influence on the baseball world, <i>The Most Famous Woman in Baseball</i> vividly documents her social activism. Her life played out against the backdrop of the Jim Crow years, when discrimination forced most of Newark&#x2019;s blacks to live in the Third Ward, where prostitution flourished, housing was among the nation&#x2019;s worst, and only menial jobs were available. Manley and the Eagles gave African Americans a haven, Ruppert Stadium. She also proposed reforms at the Negro leagues&#x2019; team owners&#x2019; meetings, marched on picket lines, sponsored charity balls and benefit games, and collected money for the NAACP. With vision, beauty, intelligence, discipline, and an acerbic wit, Manley was a force of nature&#x2014;and, as Bob Luke shows, one to be reckoned with.</p><p>Bob Luke is the author of three books, including <i>The Baltimore Elite Giants: Sport and Society in the Age of Negro League Baseball</i> and numerous articles on the history of baseball and the Negro Leagues. He lives in Garrett Park, Maryland."Had Effa Manley&#x2019;s real life ever been submitted as a Hollywood script, it would have been rejected as too far-fetched. Effa was part temptress, part civil rights crusader, and all shrewd and calculating businesswoman. In the capable hands of esteemed blackball historian Bob Luke, her life story becomes symbolic of the Negro leagues themselves: cool, defiant, and incandescent. What a great read!"&#x2014;Timothy M. Gay, author of <i>Satch, Dizzy &amp; Rapid Robert: The Wild Saga of Interracial Baseball before Jackie Robinson</i> (Timothy M. Gay)<br><br>"I played for Effa Manley and the Eagles for nine years. Bob Luke tells what it was like for myself and my teammates to play in the Negro leagues for that remarkable woman. Luke&#x2019;s book brings back many memories."&#x2014;Monte Irvin, Baseball Hall of Famer (Monte Irvin)<br><br>"Before the color line was broken, Effa Manley was &#x2018;Queen of the Negro leagues.&#x2019; Bob Luke has written a gem of a book. He restores Manley to our memory with all her complexity and controversy. Here is a biography about business, beauty, and baseball. Her life rides the wings of the Newark Eagles once again. <i>The Most Famous Woman in Baseball</i> is about a woman who was fabulous if not furious at times. Manley loved baseball, and we should all be grateful to her contributions to the American Pastime."&#x2014;E.

Fighting in the Greek-style with a heavy infantry was proving increasingly outdated and inflexible, resulting in the Roman&#39;s defeat at the hands of the Gauls at the battle of Allia. Following on from this catastrophe and in the next fifty years of warfare against Gallic and Italian tribes, a military revolution was born: the legion. This was a new unit of organization made up of three flexible lines of maniples consisting of troops of both heavy and light infantry. However, at the end of the 3rd century BC, Rome&#39;s prestige was shattered once more by the genius of Hannibal of Carthage, causing Roman battle tactics to be revised again. The legendary general Scipio Africanus achieved this, finally destroying the Carthaginian army at the climactic victory of Zama. A wholly new kind of soldier had been invented, and the whole Mediterranean world was now at Rome&#39;s feet. This book reveals these two defining moments in Roman military history and the revolution in battle tactics that was the result, examining how the Roman army eventually became all-conquering and all-powerful.</p><p>Ross Cowan was formerly a research student at the University of Glasgow where he was recently awarded a PhD for a thesis on the Roman army entitled &#39;Aspects of the Severan Field Army AD 193-238.&#39; The major themes of the thesis are the organisation of the Praetorian Guard and Legio II Parthica, their recruitment, numbers and equipment. Ross also completed his first degree at Glasgow. In 1999 he was elected a fellow of the Society of the Antiquaries of Scotland. He has previously written Elite 155 Roman Battle Tactics 109 BC-AD 313. The author lives in Glasgow, Scotland.&#x201c;Roman Battle Tactics by Nic Fields, Ph.D. is an excellently researched instructive manual on the various skirmishes and war maneuvers of the Roman Empire from 390 B.C. to 110 B.C. Fields displays his extensive knowledge of ancient history brilliantly, and without sounding the least bit dry...&nbsp;&nbsp;The chronological explanations of the names, uses, weapons, and training methods of each type of unit the Romans used was especially helpful in understanding how each victory came about.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Meredith Greene, San Francisco Book Review (March 2010)</i></p><h2>How Successful People Lead: Taking Your Influence to the Next Level</h2><p><b>In this perfectly compact read, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author John C.

The sketches portray the impoverished masses that Pasolini calls "the sub-proletariat," those who live under Third World conditions and for whom simple pleasures, such as a blue sweater in a storefront window, are completely out of reach. <br><br>Pasolini's art develops throughout the works collected here, from his early lyricism to tragicomic outlines for screenplays, and finally to the maturation of his Neo-realism in eight chronicles on the shantytowns of Rome. The pieces in this collection were all published in Italian journals and newspapers, and then later edited by Walter Siti in the original Italian edition.</p><p><b>Pier Paolo Pasolini </b>(1922-1975) was an internationally acclaimed writer, poet, critic, actor, director, and filmmaker. Among his most noted films are his epic masterpiece A<i>ccatone!, The Gospel According to St. Matthew, Teorema</i>, and <i>Marquis de Sade.</i> He was the author of several novels, most notably <i>The Ragazzi</i> (Ragazzi di vita), as well as books of short stories, essays, and collections of poetry.<br><br><b>Marina Harss</b> is a freelance dance writer and translator in New York. Her translations include <i>For Solo Violin</i>, a war memoir by Aldo Zargani, and stories in <i>The Forbidden Stories of Marta Veneranda</i>, by Sonia Rivera-Vald.

His voice is like no one else&#x2019;s&#x2014;immediate yet grounded in a brilliant and completely individual perspective, lyrical but never blindly romantic.

Contemporaries of Louis Armstrong, most of them had played in local obscurity until Preservation Hall launched a nationwide revival of interest in traditional jazz. They called themselves &#x201c;the mens.&#x201d; And they welcomed the young apprentice into their ranks.<br><br>The boy was introduced into this remarkable fellowship by his father, an eccentric Southern liberal and failed novelist whose powerful articles on race had made him one of the most effective polemicists of the early Civil Rights movement. Nurtured on his father&#x2019;s belief in racial equality, the aspiring clarinetist embraced the old musicians with a boundless love and admiration. The narrative unfolds against the vivid backdrop of New Orleans in the 1950s and &#x2018;60s. But that magical place is more than decor; it is perhaps the central player, for this story could not have taken place in any other city in the world.</p><p><b>Tom Sancton </b>graduated from Harvard in 1971 and attended Oxford as a <br>Rhodes scholar.

It was early in the morning<br>when the mourners started arriving at the funeral home on Louisiana Avenue.<br>By noon, five thousand people and two brass bands jammed the broad two-lane<br>thoroughfare outside, waiting to take the great trumpeter on his last ride. Two<br>dozen motorcycle cops revved their engines, preparing to escort the cortege&#x2014;<br>and ready to deal with any violence if things got out of hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the crowded funeral parlor, black friends and relatives of the fallen<br>jazzman mingled with his many white admirers&#x2014;among them, the mayor, a<br>congressman, prominent businessmen, lawyers, university professors, socialites,<br>writers, journalists. There were few places in New Orleans where the races could<br>gather under one roof in those Jim Crow days: segregation was the law of the<br>land in Louisiana. But they made an exception for Papa Celestin. Apart from<br>Louis Armstrong, perhaps, he was the closest thing to a local hero that the city<br>could claim. President Eisenhower had even honored him at the White House<br>and told him he was &#x201c;a credit to his race.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was five years old and knew nothing about Papa Celestin.

Nearby, my father hovered protectively over my<br>sisters, Wendy, nine, and Beth, eight.

Mr. Ware is right in stating in his introduction that &#34;&#34;four centuries of Turkish rule have left -- for good or evil -- a permanent mark upon the Greek Orthodox world&#34;&#34; and that &#34;&#34;without taking into account the way Greeks thought and felt under Turkish domination, and the way their theology developed between 1453 and 1821, it is all but impossible to understand the present condition of Greek Orthodoxy.&#34;&#34; The book begins with an extremely valuable and well-documented chapter on the general state of Orthodoxy under Islam, with a special emphasis on the relations between the Greeks and the Latins. A modern &#34;&#34;ecumenicist&#34;&#34; will discover here many puzzling facts that could help him overcome some of the current oversimplifications. Chapter 2 gives us an exhaustive biography of Argenti and in chapter 3 through 4 the main theological problems debated by Argenti -- Baptism, Eucharist, purgatory, and papacy--are presented in a clear and penetrating way. Finally, a list of Argenti&#39;s writings and a bibliography crown this scholarly book. As said above, the importance of the book goes beyond the personal case of Argenti: it helps us understand the tragedy of Eastern Orthodoxy at the time when the West was reaching the climax of its religious and cultural development. &#34;&#34;Squeezed&#34;&#34; between Latin and Protestant influences, deprived of academic centers, Orthodox theology often surrendered to pressure. Mr. Ware&#39;s point is that in the case of Argenti it avoided such a surrender and preserved its tradition from deviations and errors. -- Alexander Schmemann, St. Vladimir Seminary Quarterly 9.2 (1965) About the Contributor(s): Kallistos Ware is an English bishop within the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and one of the best-known contemporary Eastern Orthodox theologians.

Atrocities from around the world shake us nearly every day, and we all experience trials in our own lives too. In this book the former Archbishop of Canterbury looks in depth at the trial of Jesus, using it to teach readers how to face the challenges of life in today's trying times.<br><br> Bringing the biblical accounts of Jesus' trial vividly to life, Rowan Williams highlights what can be learned about Jesus from each of the four Gospel portraits. Mark shows a mysterious figure revealed as the Son of God. Matthew describes the Wisdom of God tried by foolish men. Luke presents a divine stranger. John speaks of the paradox of divinity submitting to judgement. These illuminating discussions are followed by a reflection on Christian martyrdom and a meditation on tyranny, freedom, and truth. A set of discussion questions and a thought-provoking prayer after each chapter make&nbsp;<i>Christ on Trial</i>&nbsp;an ideal book for study groups.<br><br> Throughout the book Williams draws not only from the Bible but also from fiction, drama, and current events, pointing up ways in which society today continues to put Christ on trial. Even more, he argues that&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;Christians stand with Jesus before a watching world. Though we may not be directly confronted with death, we are nevertheless called daily to respond to the falsehood of such lures as power, influence, and prestige.<br><br> Several words aptly describe this book by Rowan Williams: Profound. Incisive. Literary. Contemporary. Relevant. Prophetic.&nbsp;<i>Christ on Trial</i>&nbsp;will move and change those who read it.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>In this probing book Oliver O'Donovan extends the exploration into the correspondence between theology and politics that he began in "The Desire of the Nations." While that earlier work took as its starting point the biblical proclamation of God's authority, "The Ways of Judgment" approaches political theology from the political side. Responsive to developments such as the uncertain role of the United Nations after the Cold War and the expansion of the European Union, O'Donovan also draws on the extensive tradition of Christian political thought and a range of contemporary theologians.<p>Rather than supposing, as does some political theology, that the right political orientations are well understood and that theological beliefs should be renegotiated to fit them, O'Donovan considers contemporary social and political realities to be impenetrably obscure and elusive. Finding the gospel proclamation luminous by contrast, O'Donovan sheds light from the Christian faith upon the intricate challenge of seeking the good in late-modern Western society.</p><p>Pursuing his analysis in three movements, O'Donovan first considers the paradigmatic political act, the act of judgment, and then takes up the question of forming political institutions through representation. Finally, he tackles the opposition between political institutions and the church, provocatively investigating how Christians can be the community instructed by Jesus to "judge not."</p>Oliver O&#39;Donovan is a fellow of the British Academy andprofessor emeritus of Christian ethics and practical theologyat the University of Edinburgh. His other books includeThe Desire of the Nations, The Ways of Judgment,and Resurrection and Moral Order.</p><h2>Interrupted Music: The Making of Tolkien&#39;s Mythology</h2><p><p><em>An eagerly awaited exploration of Tolkien&#x2019;s Silmarillion</em></p> <p>The content of Tolkien&#x2019;s mythology, the Silmarillion, has been the subject of considerable exploration and analysis for many years, but the logistics of its development have been mostly ignored and deserve closer investigation.</p> <p>Nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars understood the term mythology as a gathering of song and story that derived from and described an identifiable world. Tolkien made a continuous effort over several years to construct a comprehensive mythology, to include not only the stories themselves but also the storytellers, scribes, and bards who were the offspring of his thought.</p> <p><em>In Interrupted Music</em> Flieger attempts to illuminate the structure of Tolkien&#x2019;s work, allowing the reader to appreciate its broad, overarching design and its careful, painstaking construction. She endeavors to &#x201c;follow the music from its beginning as an idea in Tolkien&#x2019;s mind through to his final but never-implemented mechanism for realizing that idea, for bringing the voices of his story to the reading public.&#x201d; In addition, Flieger reviews attempts at mythmaking in the history of English literature by Spenser, Milton, and Blake as well as by Joyce and Yeats. She reflects on the important differences between Tolkien and his predecessors and even more between Tolkien and his contemporaries.</p> <p>This in-depth study will fascinate those interested in Tolkien and fantasy literature.</p></p><p><strong>Verlyn Flieger</strong> is professor emerita of English at the University of Maryland at College Park.

We meet Kate at a crucial moment in middle age when she begins to yearn to see the son she abandoned when she was seventeen. But if she decides to seek him, will he understand her? Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, <i>Kate Vaiden</i> is a penetrating psychological portrait of an ordinary woman in extraordinary circumstances, a story as joyous, tragic, comic and compelling as life itself.</p><p>Familial dysfunction defines this Price effort--his first experiment with a first-person narrator in a full-length novel. Kate Vaiden is left parentless as a child when her father fatally shoots her mother and then himself. As an adult, Kate attests, &#34;I&#39;d caused their deaths.&#34; She isn&#39;t the only one in such a predicament: her mother&#39;s mother died in childbirth, and the father of her child was raised an orphan. Trapped in a self-defeating cycle, Kate forever seeks stability, only to flee when it gravitates within her reach. This rich Southern tale, which won a National Book Critics Award in 1986, is slathered with Christian themes of guilt, salvation, shame and, occasionally, triumph.e, Kate Vaiden begins to yearn to see the son she abandoned when she was seventeen. But if she decides to seek him, will he understand her or even want to see her? As Kate questions herself and remembers her history, a story unfolds as tragic, comic and compelling as life itself . . .</p><h2>Ghost on Black Mountain</h2><p><b>ONCE A PERSON LEAVES THE MOUNTAIN, THEY NEVER COME BACK, NOT REALLY.

Setting type and learning to write under Joseph Addison Turner&#x2019;s mentoring at nearby Turnwold Plantation, Harris later worked for newspapers in Macon and Forsyth. He served as Associate Editor for the <i>Savannah Morning News</i> (1870-1876) and for the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i> (1876-1900). Harris earned reputations as a literary comedian, a talented and resourceful amateur folklorist, a local-color fiction writer, a children&#x2019;s author, and a major New South journalist. He wrote 185 Uncle Remus tales, seven volumes of short fiction, four novels and six collections of children&#x2019;s stories. Harris&#x2019;s portraits of poor whites and his socio-logically and rhetorically complex Brer Rabbit trickster stories have influenced generations of writers, from Mark Twain to Zora Neale Hurston, William Faulkner, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, and Julius Lester. Harris&#x2019;s creation of highly animated, believably anthropomorphic animal characters also helped reinvent the modern children&#x2019;s story, from Rudyard Kipling&#x2019;s jungle tales to Beatrix Potter&#x2019;s Peter Rabbit stories. Brer Rabbit and the Tar Baby have also become popular culture icons. Harris died in 1908.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>JOHN T.

Harris explains in detail the unique experience he had that night, and he made sure to include this important episode in his introduction to his second book, <i>Nights with Uncle Remus: Myths and Legends of the Old Plantation</i> (1883). The train was late, and darkness had already fallen when Harris overheard several black railroad workers sitting in small groups on the platform and perched on crossties, cracking jokes at each other&#x2019;s expense and laughing boisterously. Harris sat down next to one of the liveliest talkers in the group, a middle-aged worker. After enjoying their banter for awhile, Harris heard someone in the crowd mention &#x201c;Ole Molly Har&#x2019;.&#x201d; Suddenly inspired, and &#x201c;in a low tone, as if to avoid attracting attention,&#x201d; Harris narrated the tar-baby story to his companion, &#x201c;by way of a feeler.&#x201d;</p><p>Harris reconstructs in some detail what occurred next, a folkloristic event any ethnologist today would swap the SUV for. The lively man next to Harris kept interrupting the tar-baby narration with loud and frequent comments&#x2014;&#x201c;Dar now!&#x201d; and &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a honey, mon!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Gentermens! git out de way, an&#x2019; gin &#x2019;im room!&#x201d; Suddenly, Harris&#x2019;s audience of one grows exponentially into a storytelling community of thirty.</p><p></p><p>These comments, and the peals of unrestrained and unrestrainable laughter that accompanied them, drew the attention of the other Negroes, and before the climax of the story had been reached, where Brother Rabbit is cruelly thrown into the brier-patch, they had all gathered around and made themselves comfortable. Without waiting to see what the effect of the &#x2018;Tar Baby&#x2019; legend would be, the writer [Harris] told the story of &#x2018;Brother Rabbit and the Mosquitoes,&#x2019; and this had the effect of convulsing them. Two or three could hardly wait for the conclusion, so anxious were they to tell stories of their own. The result was that, for almost two hours, a crowd of thirty or more Negroes vied with each other to see which could tell the most and the best stories.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Harris notes that some of the black workers told stories poorly, &#x201c;giving only meager outlines,&#x201d; while others &#x201c;told them passing well.&#x201d; And then he adds that &#x201c;one or two, if their language and gestures could have been taken down, would have put Uncle Remus to shame.&#x201d; Harris, always the astute observer, stresses that a storyteller&#x2019;s language and gestures must interact with the audience&#x2019;s emotions to create a truly memorable oral performance.</p><p>That evening, Harris goes on to explain, he heard a few stories he had already included among the thirty-four animal tales in <i>Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings.</i> He also heard several that he had previously &#x201c;gathered and verified&#x201d; but had not yet published. Yet &#x201c;the great majority were either new or had been entirely forgotten.&#x201d; Then Harris shares an insight that reflects on the collective psyche of his fellow storytellers and, even more importantly, on his own conflicted self. Harris explains that the darkness that night &#x201c;gave greater scope and freedom to the narratives of the negroes, and but for this friendly curtain, it is doubtful if the conditions would have been favorable to storytelling.&#x201d; Furthermore, &#x201c;however favorable the conditions might have been, the appearance of a note-book and pencil would have dissipated them as utterly as if they had never existed.&#x201d;</p><p>Like a professional folklorist, which he never claimed to be, Harris knew the inhibiting effects on his human sources of introducing the reporter&#x2019;s pad in a natural, unforced, oral-performance setting. Gifted with a remarkably discriminating ear and auditory memory, however, Harris carried off the Norcross stories in his head as surely as he had stored away the Middle Georgia black folk tales he had heard from Aunt Crissy, Old Harbert, and Uncle George Terrell while he worked as a printer&#x2019;s devil at Turnwold Plantation, outside Eatonton, in the mid-1860s. A decade later, when the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i>&#x2019;s staff local colorist had taken a leave of absence, Harris had filled in for him. His memory banks had opened up, and out hopped brash Brer Rabbit, aided and abetted by his sly raconteur Uncle Remus&#x2014;whom critics have proven to be as much the trickster as his wily folk hero.</p><p>Harris had named Uncle Remus after a gardener in Forsyth, Georgia; but he also explained that Remus was an amalgamation of three or four black slave storytellers he knew, including Turnwold&#x2019;s Harbert and George Terrell. Yet Remus is also more: he is a mitigating voice, created in part to comfort anxious minds of Reconstruction-era America. His is the soothing voice of wisdom, reassuring white America with his loyalty to memories of the Old South&#x2014;and meanwhile working for reconciliation between blacks and whites and between the regions after the War. Uncle Remus is also far more complex than his family retainer role suggests, for he is the product of what Harris would later memorably call his &#x201c;other fellow&#x201d;&#x2014;the deeper and bolder part of Harris&#x2019;s psyche that takes over from the newspaper journalist and writes folk tales and fiction, the ostensibly plain and Christian voice that suddenly shifts paradigms and tells stories that are anything but plain and Christian. Along with the young white Abercrombie boy, Remus&#x2019;s devoted pupil, we learn&#x2014;as Brer Rabbit lures Brer Wolf into a honey-log and burns him alive, or as he tricks Brer Wolf into selling his grandmother for vittles or, indeed, tricks Grinny Granny Wolf into boiling herself alive and subsequently feeds her flesh to her own son&#x2014;that Brer Rabbit&#x2019;s morality is not the morality of nineteenth-century white Christianity.</p><p>The Norcross evening reveals something else important about Harris&#x2019;s psyche, too. He was an illegitimate child, and generous citizens of Eatonton, Middle Georgia, had luckily befriended him and his mother. Shy and self-conscious all his life, and afflicted with a mild stammer, he never read his Brer Rabbit stories aloud, not even to his own children. In fact, in May 1882, just prior to the Norcross encounter, Harris had met with Mark Twain and George Washington Cable in New Orleans to discuss joining them for a lucrative national reading tour. But Harris&#x2019;s inveterate, self-effacing shyness had forced him to decline their attractive invitation. Yet that summer night in the comforting and anonymous darkness at Norcross, Harris was relaxed and unobtrusive. Moreover&#x2014;and for the only time in his life that we know of&#x2014;he was actually able to tell some of his beloved folk stories in a public setting. It&#x2019;s as if Harris&#x2019;s &#x201c;other fellow&#x201d; had taken control again and had spoken for him in a deeper tongue.</p><p>Harris&#x2019;s payoff for temporarily escaping his self-consciousness was two rich and rarefied hours of cross-racial communion and oral folklore performance and story-collecting. Furthermore, the Norcross station tales Harris heard that summer, and the stories they reminded him of, fed directly into his second book, his ambitious and carefully structured collection of seventy-one folk stories, <i>Nights with Uncle Remus: Myths and Legends of the Old Plantation</i>. Published in November 1883, a little over a year after his fruitful Norcross experience, <i>Nights</i> was another popular and critical success for Harris. While its sales would never equal those of <i>Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings</i>, his second book nevertheless sold 25,000 copies across twenty-five print-runs in the mid-1880s. Even two decades later, <i>Nights</i> was still doing well; a 1904 edition sold over 80,000 copies. Including posthumous collections, the Uncle Remus canon would eventually grow to 185 published stories.</p><p>In a chapter of his 2001 study, <i>R...</i></p></p><h2>Call on Me (A Loving on the Edge Novel)</h2><p><b>The new Loving on the Edge novel by the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Nothing Between Us</i> and <i>Need You Tonight... </i></b><br><br>Oakley Easton wants two things: to be a good mom to her daughter and to ditch her less than ideal night job.

She lives in Dallas with her husband and son. If she&#x2019;s not working on her latest sexy story, you can find her reading, watching reality television, or indulging in her unhealthy addiction to rockstars, er, rock concerts&#x2014;yeah, that&#x2019;s it.<p></p><p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>&#x201c;Are you touching yourself?&#x201d; The voice in Oakley&#x2019;s ear sounded labored and overeager&#x2014;like a Saint Bernard attempting phone sex. He was probably drooling, too. Lovely.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, you make me so hot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;&#x2014;she quickly checked the sticky note she&#x2019;d put on the kitchen island&#x2014;&#x201c;Stefan.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Stefan. Literature professor. Single. Six foot five.</i></p><p>That&#x2019;s the info he&#x2019;d given her. Which probably meant: <i>Steve, unemployed, married, and five-six on a good day</i>.</p><p>He groaned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so sexy.&#x201d;</p><p>Sexy? <i>Two points off for lack of originality, Mr. Lit Prof.</i> Though, even the suave guys tended to forget their vocabulary when they got to this point in the conversation. Oakley covered the mouthpiece on her headset and turned off the timer on the oven. If nothing else, she was impressed the guy had lasted through the full baking time.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, sugar,&#x201d; she said, letting her tone drop into a lower register.</p><p>&#x201c;God, your voice is so fucking hot.&#x201d;</p><p>That she heard a lot. A record company exec had once deemed her voice &#x201c;smoky, X-rated perfection&#x201d; when he&#x2019;d heard her demo. At the time, she hadn&#x2019;t considered how inappropriate it had been for a grown man to tell a fifteen-year-old kid that. But her raspy voice had gotten her the gig then, and it had gotten her this one now. Though, admittedly, the bar wasn&#x2019;t set quite as high for this current one.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna give it to you so hard, Sasha,&#x201d; Stefan ground out. &#x201c;I can feel your hot mouth closing around me.&#x201d;</p><p>Oakley donned oven mitts and leaned down to pull out the tray of brownies. The smell of chocolate and the heat of the oven hit her with full force. She inhaled deeply. &#x201c;Mmm, that&#x2019;s <i>so</i> good. I could just lick up every last bit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he panted, the sound of his slick, pumping fist obscenely clear through the receiver. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Show me how much you want it.&#x201d;</p><p><i>There you go, Steve, you go on and get your money&#x2019;s worth. </i>Oakley set the tray of brownies on a trivet and tugged off the mitts. Her stomach rumbled. She&#x2019;d stayed up late enough that her body was looking for dinner number two. But these weren&#x2019;t for her.</p><p>She glanced toward the darkened hallway and the stairs beyond. Well, maybe one little corner piece wouldn&#x2019;t be missed. She cut a small square and dipped her fingers in to grab it. But as she lifted the brownie, her knuckles grazed the searing hot pan.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, shit!&#x201d; she hissed, jerking her hand back.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah, let me hear it,&#x201d; Stefan said on a moan. &#x201c;Come with me, baby.&#x201d;</p><p>Oakley shook out her hand, sucking air through her teeth, and tried to keep the pain out of her voice. Her phone companion thought she was mid-orgasm. She threw in an <i>oh, oh, oh</i> and ran to the sink to plunge her fist into the dishwater she&#x2019;d drawn to soak the mixing bowl.</p><p>Stefan made choked sounds as he reached his own release. In another world, maybe it could&#x2019;ve been an erotic moment. She&#x2019;d talked a guy into an orgasm. He was calling her name. But the name was fake and so was the talk. And though she held nothing against the guys who called&#x2014;after all, they helped her pay the bills&#x2014;her libido had long ago crawled into a dark corner to die a quick, peaceful death. Even if she imagined the guy on the other end of the line looked like Johnny Depp or Justin Timberlake or something, she couldn&#x2019;t drum up one ounce of interest.</p><p>Stefan panted heavy, wet breaths right against her ear, resuming his resemblance to a Saint Bernard. Maybe she should offer him a &#x201c;good boy&#x201d; or a Milk-Bone.</p><p>&#x201c;That was amazing,&#x201d; she said, using her husky, after-sex voice as she soaked her hand in the water. &#x201c;Thank you, Stefan.&#x201d;</p><p>Panting. Panting. That was the only response.</p><p>Then a tight, high sound&#x2014;whistling.</p><p>No. <i>Wheezing</i>.</p><p>Uh-oh. &#x201c;Stefan? Are you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Those squeaking breaths continued for a few seconds then: &#x201c;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fine.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t sound fine. &#x201c;Stefan, if you&#x2019;re having an asthma attack or chest pains or something, you need to call for help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He gave a ragged cough. &#x201c;My wife&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can&#x2019;t know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m down here this late. She&#x2019;ll know I&#x2019;m up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>He coughed again.</p><p>Jesus Christ. Oakley shook the water off her hand. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s she going to think when she finds you dead in the basement? Hang up the phone and dial 911.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stu?&#x201d; a sharp voice said in the background. &#x201c;What are you doing down here? <i>Stu?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, shit,&#x201d; Stefan/Stu said between wheezes.</p><p>The dial tone buzzed in Oakley&#x2019;s ear a second later.</p><p>She pulled off the wireless headset and sagged against the fridge, exhaling a long breath. Okay. It would be all right. Stu&#x2019;s wife might kill him when she found him with the phone to his ear and his underwear around his ankles, but at least the guy wouldn&#x2019;t die of a heart attack on Oakley&#x2019;s watch.</p><p>She could handle a lot of stuff&#x2014;callers threw all kinds of bizarre shit at her&#x2014;but she couldn&#x2019;t be responsible for helping kill one. It was bad enough that she&#x2019;d just contributed to strife in another marriage.</p><p>Gold star for her.</p><p>It shouldn&#x2019;t bother her. The guys who called were grown men making a conscious decision to seek out paid phone sex. She was simply the tool of choice. Another night, they may download porn and watch a dirty movie instead. If she&#x2019;d learned anything during her years of doing this job, it was that it wasn&#x2019;t personal. She had a job to do. The callers needed a faceless someone to fill in for their fantasy that night. The relationship was purely transactional. And hell, she&#x2019;d been used for free by enough people in her past. Now she was at least paid for it and not getting emotionally annihilated in the process. But still, sometimes she felt like the drug dealer, giving addicts easy access to their vice.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders, trying to shrug off the stress of the call, and dug a tube of antibiotic ointment out of the junk drawer to slather on her burned knuckles. It was past two and she really needed to get to bed, but there was no way she&#x2019;d be able to sleep after that burst of adrenaline from the call.</p><p>Plus, she&#x2019;d never gotten her dessert. And right now, she could use a big honking piece of chocolate.</p><p>She went back to the brownies. They&#x2019;d cooled enough by now, so she cut herself a bigger square than the original corner she&#x2019;d planned and took a bite. She closed her eyes. <i>Yeah, that&#x2019;s the stuff.</i></p><p>After pouring a big glass of milk, she brought that and the rest of the brownie to the table. She glanced at the walkie-talkie she&#x2019;d placed on the table, the soft white noise relaxing her, and leaned back in the chair to enjoy the solitude. She was used to pulling the night shift by now, but usually she fell into bed after the last call, grasping for any shreds of sleep she could get before the alarm went off to start her real job. But it was nice to sit for a moment and simply be.</p><p>She polished off the last bit of brownie and milk and brought her glass to the sink. The exhaustion was settling in full force now. She braced her hands on the edge of the counter and eyed the soaking dishes. Her mother had always had the rule to never go to bed with a dirty sink&#x2014;as if a bright, gleaming, empty sink was some sign of how together the household was. Maybe it was.</p><p>Oakley turned away from the dishes. They&#x2019;d have to wait until tomorrow. She didn&#x2019;t have it in her.</p><p>She put foil over the rest of the brownies and grabbed the walkie-talkie and her headset. She should be able to get at least four hours of sleep. But right as she flipped off the light, the walkie-talkie beeped.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d;</p><p>Oakley halted, startled by the sudden break in the quiet. She pressed the button on the side of the device. &#x201c;Yeah, baby?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that smell?&#x201d; Reagan asked, her voice groggy from sleep.</p><p>Oakley shook her head and smiled. She should&#x2019;ve known the bionic nose would pick up that scent even in her sleep. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just the brownies for your bake sale tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my bake sale. It&#x2019;s the school&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Reagan corrected.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I meant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not what you said.&#x201d;</p><p>Oakley leaned against the wall in the hallway. This was an argument she&#x2019;d never win. Reagan was into exactness. When Oakley told people Rae was eleven, Rae would jump in and specify how many months past eleven she was. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I said it wrong the first time. Now go back to sleep, sweetheart. I don&#x2019;t want you to be tired in the morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you put nuts or caramel in them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not. I know you&#x2019;re a brownie purist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Good,&#x201d; Reagan said, and Oakley could almost hear her daughter nodding. &#x201c;Thanks, Mom. Love you.&#x201d;</p><p>Oakley pressed the walkie-talkie to her chest for a moment, warmth filling her. &#x201c;Love you, too, Rae. Good night.&#x201d;</p><p>Oakley headed to her bedroom, listening to the footfalls upstairs and the flush of the toilet as Reagan made a quick trip to the bathroom. She must&#x2019;ve really had to go because Rae hated getting out of bed in the middle of the night. And she outright refused to come downstairs after dark&#x2014;a phobia she&#x2019;d developed years ago and hadn&#x2019;t been able to shake yet.</p><p>Hence the walkie-talkies. Oakley had gotten tired of Reagan yelling from afar anytime she needed something at night. And leaving every light blazing through the house all evening wasn&#x2019;t an option either. The electric bill was already high enough.</p><p><i>Bills</i>. No, she wouldn&#x2019;t think about that now. Even though she could see the stack staring at her from her desk. The gas bill. Rent. The quarterly installment for Reagan&#x2019;s private school and therapies. She couldn&#x2019;t face that tonight. Plus, she knew the due dates by heart so she could hold on to her money until the very last minute without being late.</p><p>She closed her bedroom door and walked over to her computer to wake the screen. Her sign-in page for the service she used to get her calls was still up. It showed how many minutes she&#x2019;d logged tonight. Not bad. But she was six minutes shy of hitting the bonus level where she got an extra fifty bucks for the night. Stu&#x2019;s health scare had cost her more than stress.</p><p>She sighed and sagged into her desk chair. Fifty extra dollars could pay for that pair of lime green Chuck Taylors Reagan wanted for her birthday.</p><p>Oakley yawned and checked the box that indicated she was available to take a call. Her cell phone rang within seconds and she slipped on the headset again. &#x201c;Hello, this is Sasha. Ready for a fantasy night?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So ready,&#x201d; said the deep-voiced caller. There was male tittering in the background.</p><p>Great. A frat-boy call.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you wearing, Sasha?&#x201d;</p><p>Oakley looked down at her oversized T-shirt and yoga pants. &#x201c;A sheer robe with nothing underneath.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aw, yeah,&#x201d; the dude said. &#x201c;How big are your tits?&#x201d;</p><p>Oakley put her head to her desk. Six minutes. She only needed to keep them on the phone for six more minutes.</p><p>Six.</p><p>Five.</p><p>Four.</p><p>Three.</p><p>They hung up at two, laughing in the background as the phone went dead, their Truth or Dare game complete.</p><p>And she was short.</p><p>She lifted her head and checked the Available box again.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, this is Sasha&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>TWO</p><p>The chick in his living room was taking a selfie next to his gold record. Pike leaned back, watching her through his half-open bedroom door. &#x201c;Fantastic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s fantastic?&#x201d; his friend Gibson asked on the other end of the line. &#x201c;Did you even hear what I said?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t. And what&#x2019;s fantastic is that I have a seriously hot B-list actress in my living room, who was all kinds of cool after the show tonight but is now snapping duckface selfies in front of my shit.&#x201d;</p><p>Gibson snorted a laugh. &#x201c;At least she&#x2019;s not using you just for your body.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That I&#x2019;d be okay with. But this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, if there&#x2019;s no selfie for proof, the event never happened. At least that&#x2019;s what my niece tells me. It&#x2019;s like a tree falling in the woods.&#x201d;</p><p>Pike sighed. &#x201c;Observation: Duckface is a friend to no one.&#x201d;</p><p>The longer Pike watched, the more he regretted his decision to bring this woman home with him. He&#x2019;d been buzzing off the energy of the performance tonight and had wanted to keep that feeling going. Darkfall had kicked ass on stage and had impressed the promoters who were putting together some of this summer&#x2019;s biggest tours. If Darkfall landed a sweet opening spot with some big-time band, they&#x2019;d have a chance to recapture some of the traction they&#x2019;d lost when their lead singer had taken extended time off between albums to get surgery on his vocal cords.

The greatest threat lies in Persia to the east, where the massing forces of the Sassanid Empire loom with fiery menace. There the isolated Roman citadel of Arete awaits inevitable invasion. One man is sent to marshal the defences and shore up crumbling walls. A man whose name itself means war: a man called Ballista. Alone, Ballista is called to muster the forces and the courage to stand first and to stand hard against the greatest enemy ever to confront the Imperium. This is part one of Warrior of Rome: an epic of empire, of heroes, of treachery, of courage, and most of all, a story of brutal bloody warfare.</p><p>Dr Harry Sidebottom is a Fellow of St Benet&#39;s Hall and lecturer at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he specializes in ancient warfare and classical art. All six of his Warrior of Rome novels are available from Penguin in paperback and ebook.In this blood and guts tale of ancient warfare, Oxford lecturer Sidebottom introduces readers to Marcus Clodius Bastilla, a third-century warrior who has risen through the ranks of the Roman army to achieve citizenship and the honorific of <i>Dux Ripea</i>. Charged by the emperors Valerian and Gallienus with the responsibility of defending the empire's eastern borders, Bastilla says good-bye to his new wife and sets sail for the East. Once he arrives at the Syrian city of Arete on the banks of the Euphrates, Bastilla organizes his legionaries to defend against the besieging Sassanid Persian army and hold out until reinforcements can arrive. In addition to having his hands full with the invading army, Bastilla must also deal with traitors, saboteurs, assassins and patrician officers who resent obeying the orders of a low-born superior. How the brave and resourceful former barbarian defends himself from forces both within and without the city walls forms the spine of this action-packed and detail-rich narrative. This novel of sharp swords and blunt wit should find an appreciative audience among bloodthirsty battle boys of all ages. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Eleventh Hour has its roots in the parable of the laborers in the vineyard. The following questions run through the book: why did the latecomers receive the same wage as those who had laboured throughout the heat of the day? Why were they the first to be paid? And why, did Christ say &#39;And the last shall be first?&#39; These questions are answered in the light of the concept of the Millennium, which is clearly the equivalent of the new Golden Age of the next cycle of time, and which is found in all three monotheistic religions, bringing them into line, in this respect, with Hinduism, Greco-Roman Antiquity and Buddhism.</p><p><b>Martin Lings </b>(born 1909) studied at Oxford and was a pupil and then friend of C S Lewis.

Through the intimate details of their daily lives, she shows us how civil rights affected a working-class town, among three generations of women and men. McDowell movingly uncovers a world rarely portrayed, where she was raised to love the sounds and meanings of words and to value a place and culture that has passed. "What an eye McDowell has for important stories hidden in the everyday details, and what a good storyteller she is."&#x2015;Tonya Bolden, <em>Washington Post Book World</em> "[McDowell] weaves the plainest drab cotton threads into a magic carpet."&#x2015;Adele Logan Alexander, <em>Women's Review of Books</em> "Engrossing. . . . The author has a seductive way with words that makes <em>Leaving Pipe Shop</em> as good as a piece of sweet potato pie served after a plate of greens and fried chicken."&#x2015;<em>Boston Globe</em> Illustrated</p><p>Americans coming of age in the 1960s faced a society in flux: attitudes about sex, race, and politics were radically changing; revolution was in the air and the nation seemed fractured, unable to find a common cause to unite its fragmented people. Author Deborah E. McDowell grew up near Birmingham, Alabama, the crucible of the civil rights movement, and the remarkable <i>Leaving Pipe Shop</i> is a memoir of those years. What distinguishes <i>Pipe Shop</i> from similar books is McDowell's emphasis on the everyday lives of ordinary people inhabiting that time and place. Martin Luther King, Ralph Abernathy, and George Wallace make only cameo appearances in this account; the main players on McDowell's stage are the members of her family, her church, and her neighborhood. <p> "Pipe Shop" refers to the black working-class neighborhood in Bessemer (just outside of Birmingham) where Deborah McDowell grew up. Her book begins with her return to Pipe Shop to investigate her father's death, part of the class-action lawsuit filed by victims of asbestos poisoning against the steel mill where he once worked. McDowell's trip home elicits plenty of memories--how her neighbors reacted to bus boycotts and boycotts of white-owned businesses, going to hear Martin Luther King speak, and the murder of her own activist pastor. <i>Leaving Pipe Shop</i> is an evocative portrait of one African American community's struggle to cope with the changes that swept through a nation.</p>Deborah E.

The end of his life is seen by the great families of the North as a chance to promote one of their own as his successor, and Thoresby himself announces he will leave the matter to the dean and chapter of York. On the eve of this decision, the dying archbishop agrees to a visit from Joan, Princess of Wales, wife of the Black Prince, heir to the throne of England. Thoresby&#x2019;s captain of the guard, Owen Archer, has no doubt that trouble will follow. <br><br> As soon as the company rides into the palace yard he is proved right: they arrive burdened with the body of one of their party, and Owen finds evidence that the man&#x2019;s death was no accident. Within days of this discovery, a courier carrying an urgent message for the archbishop is found hanging in the woods. With guards surrounding the property, it is clear that the murderer walks among the palace guests. The powerful Percy and Neville families are well represented in the entourage, including a woman who remembers an afternoon tryst with Owen as much, much more. Even the princess&#x2019; son is suspect. As Owen races to unmask the guilty and rid the palace of the royal party, his final wish for his lord is that he might die in peace.</p><p>Candace Robb has read and researched medieval history for many years, having studied for a Ph.D in Medieval and Anglo-Saxon Literature.

Classic style and British manufacturing are both experiencing a boom in demand&#x2015;driven by a desire among consumers for authentic, quality products. Britain is uniquely placed to benefit from this resurgence, given the number of heritage companies<br>still producing at the top of their game. From the world-famous<br>Barbour in South Shields in the north of England to John Lobb<br>in London, many of these fine businesses remain in family<br>ownership, protective of their traditions and justifiably proud of<br>their products. Many are the bearers of warrants from the British<br>Royal family, and all are over 100 years old. Horst Friedrichs<br>explores the historic places where these British brands have<br>become some of the strongest in the world: Johnston&#x2019;s of Elgin<br>in the north of Scotland, Corgi socks in southern Wales, and<br>John Smedley in Derbyshire. By highlighting the stories of<br>these legendary brands&#x2015;both new and old, grand and humble&#x2015;<br>Friedrichs and Crompton show how relevant these companies<br>and their traditional production techniques still are.

When she isn&#39;t writing, she spends her days with her husband, Matt, chasing their two children around their home in Northern California.Gr 8 Up-Broken Wings opens where Angel Eyes (Thomas Nelson, 2012) ended. Brielle and Jake are enjoying a relatively normal life in Stratus. Their love is strong and they know that they are destined to marry. At first glance things seem relatively quiet, although the teens are still guarded by their shield angels-Canaan and Helene. However, all is not as it appears in this small town where humans, demons, and angels interact with great frequency. Damien, the fallen angel from Angel Eyes who was responsible for the murder of Brielle's friend, as well as for organizing a pedophile ring, is back and has discovered that the teens have special gifts. Jake's hands have the power to heal and Brielle can actually see the Celestial world. Damien convinces Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness, to capture them for his own use. The plot thickens when the grave of Brielle's long-dead mother turns out to be empty, and her dad falls for a woman with evil intentions. Conflict ensues overhead as angels and fallen angels engage in an epic battle of good vs. evil-and Brielle, with her power to view the Celestial, sees it all, even when Jake is whisked skyward, away from her. At times the plot is confusing, but teens who like paranormal, edge-of-your-seat drama with a strong Christian message will enjoy this second installment in the trilogy.-Ragan O'Malley, Saint Ann's School, Brooklyn, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Boyle has earned wide acclaim and an enthusiastic following with such adventurous, inimitable novels as <i>The Tortilla Curtain, Drop City</i>, and <i>The Road to Wellville</i>. For his riveting eleventh novel, Boyle offers readers the closest thing to a thriller he has ever written, a tightly scripted page turner about the trials of Dana Halter, a thirty-three-year-old deaf woman whose identity has been stolen. Featuring a woman in the lead role (a Boyle first), <i>Talk Talk</i> is both a suspenseful chase across America and a moving story about language, love, and identity from one of America?s most versatile and entertaining novelists.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>TALK TALK</i> by T.C. Boyle</b> <br><br> "T.C. Boyle's <i>Talk Talk</i> starts off fast and never let's go - and that's fun...Boyle once again delivers an entertaining story with his usual laser commentary - about the way we identify ourselves and the role language plays."<br> -<i>USA Today</i> <br><br> "His most exciting novel yet...Boyle's new novel about identity theft is so perfectly aligned with the day's news that the FBI should search his house for stolen credit cards. <i>Talk Talk</i> grabs hold of the fragile structures that establish who we are and what we own and shakes them apart...Boyle knows how to drill down through the surface of everyday life into our core anxieties, and he knows how to write constantly charging, heart-thumping chase scenes...Boyle begins with the merely bureaucratic elements of identity, but soon he teases out the more profound ramifications of who we are and how we prove it...The current perils of Internet security give <i>Talk Talk</i> a timely hook, but there's nothing ephemeral about the novel."<br> -<i>The Washington Post</i>, front page <br><br> "By now Boyle possesses the unparalleled ability to create characters who can do far more than amuse. In fact, they're so absolutely human that they're annoying - in the way that humans are...He's sweating not to make us sympathize with his creatures but to make us comprehend them. He lavishes his prodigious - and prodigiously humane - gifts on <i>how</i> they are, not <i>who</i> they are...Boyle, though sheer empathic power, seems to have wormholed into the parallel universe of the deaf...it's not just the road but the scenery where the author marches out his chops. No character is too small to lavish with peculiar splendor...Suffice it to say that <i>Talk Talk</i> stands out as nothing short of an uncomfortable masterpiece - as simultaneously overwhelming, treacherous, beautiful and boiling over with hellacious revelation as its ultimate subject: life in twentieth-century America."<br> -<i>Los Angeles Times</i>, front page <br><br> "His least discursive, most tautly paced book to date, a tense thriller about a couple's ill-advised, cross-country pursuit of a 21st-century scourge: a dangerous identity thief. <i>Talk Talk</i> opens at full throttle and never slackens...a rage so intense that it overtakes reason runs through the book like a superhighway."<br> -<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, front page <br><br> "The outrageously talented T.C. Boyle loves nothing more than demolishing a charlatan, and his fabulously entertaining fiction is packed with megalomaniacs, hypocrites, and overbearing nincompoops who make life hell for the intelligent and sensible mensch. When Boyle finds the delicate balance between his over-the-top satirical impulses and his startling sentimentality, no American novelist can touch him...the novel flies along on the power of Boyle's propulsive and exquisitely perceptive prose."<br> -<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> <br><br> "Funny, engaging, and suspenseful...using his gift for manic invention and freewheeling, hyperventilated prose, Mr. Boyle does an antic job of recounting the cat-and-mouse-and-cat game played by Dana and Peck, wittily dancing around his theme of identity and identity theft, even as he orchestrates a sense of foreboding and suspense...he manages here to mix clever narrative pyrotechnics with real character development."<br> -<i>The New York Times</i> <br><br> "The normally extravagant T.C. Boyle tames himself in <i>Talk Talk</i> to deliver a chilling literary thriller. Or is it a horror story for our times?...Boyle has us in the fever grip of Peck's hostile takeover of Dana, the stealth attack of identity theft and the fear and fury it arouses."<br> -<i>The New York Daily News</i> <br><br> "Once again, Boyle examines a contemporary issue - identity theft - in very human terms with a very engaging story...<i>Talk Talk</i> is a good read for summer or any season. On a deeper level, though, it's much more, an examination of identity that evolves from a fast-paced chase to something far more satisfying. It's a novel you'll be likely to talk about for a long time."<br> -<i>St. Louis Post Dispatch</i> <br><br> "From its fast and fluid pace, Boyle's new novel, Talk Talk, might seem like so much entertainment chatter, but embedded within it is a meditation on the nature of communication and identity...his virtuosity at the quick-take description, and the slightly fevered feel of his prose, are on full display."<br> -<i>New York Newsday</i> <br><br> "An identity-theft thriller that will appeal even to John Grisham readers...and for those who like a little literary meat in their summer page-turners, Boyle's knack for nuanced and intelligent characterization and language hasn't deserted him here...Although it's difficult to put <i>Talk Talk</i> down once the chase begins, few readers will be able to make it past the first chapters without frantically heading to the Internet to learn how to obtain their annual credit reports from those agencies the sage people who write financial columns are always hounding us to contact."<br> -<i>The Rocky Mountain News</i> <br><br> "Boyle brings a hard boil to a contemporary conundrum...he writes with great immediacy, his characters constantly in a state of motion, agitation, and striving."<br> -<i>The New York Post</i> <br><br> "A dandy novel, complete with the timely subject of identity theft...<i>Talk Talk</i> rarely falters, the sentences sharp and the characters well defined."<br> -<i>The Atlanta Constitution Journal</i> <br><br> "However unpatriotic this attitude is, identity thieves scare me more than terrorists. Reading T.C. Boyle's stirring new novel reinforces that anxiety...this novel is truly and movingly more about identity than about theft."<br> -<i>The Miami Herald</i> <br><br> "In order to alleviate anxiety, I recommend readers run a quick credit check on themselves before they dig in...Boyle successfully draws the reader in, so that we feel the tension of Dana's isolation in her silent world...we sympathize with both the good guys and the bad guys. These world's collide in unexpected ways and make this book a thriller, a page-turner formed by a master's hand...Boyle writes with such authority it's a pleasure to bite your nails the whole way through."<br> -<i>The Pittsburgh Post Gazette</i> <br><br> "<i>Talk Talk</i> makes the lurking danger of identity theft a dizzying reality...A tricky novel of unlikely intimacies."<br> -<i>O Magazine</i> <br><br> "This time Boyle delivers a fast-paced, edge-of-your seat thriller, applying his mastery of language and characterization to the compulsively readable mode of the commercial suspense novel. He proves that he can master his literary chops to maintain the tension as well as any old pro of the genre...the great achievement of <i>Talk Talk</i> is the way the novel brings us into the moment-by-moment experience of its profoundly deaf central character. We feel and understand her every emotion and reaction."<br> -<i>the Portland Oregonian</i> <br><br> "If you are one of the 26.5 million veterans whose personal information was on that stolen laptop, stop reading right now. And under no circumstances should you buy <i>Talk Talk</i>, the latest novel by T.C. Boyle. The rest of us, though, will certainly enjoy the PEN-Faulkner Award winner's satirically clever take on that most modern of crimes, identity theft."<br> -<i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>T. C. Boyle is the author of eleven novels, including <b>World's End</b> (winner of the PEN/FaulknerAward), <b>Drop City</b> (a <b>New York Times</b> bestseller and finalist for the National Book Award), and <b>The Inner Circle</b>.

Daniel Berrigan minces no words in his assessment of that biblical era. Prophets, kings, and the gods they worship -- all are found wanting.<br><br> Berrigan examines the complex terrain of these two biblical books, opening our eyes to the deep flaws of their oft-praised characters. He shows that this dark time in biblical history is in many ways repeating itself today. The wars of these kings, Berrigan says, are our wars now, and we are fashioning our own gods to approve our misdeeds. These two books of Scripture come to vivid -- and sometimes terrifying -- life when we recognize these undeniable similarities.<br><br><i>The Kings and Their Gods</i>&nbsp;reveals Berrigan in stunning form. Here this modern-day prophet distills the wisdom gained from his long learning and his remarkable life experiences. The book is both a masterful biblical commentary and a clarion call to action. It balances polemics and poetry, despair and joy. It is truly a midrash for our troubled times -- both an indictment of the horror that is and an invitation to the great goodness that may be.</p><p>Daniel Berrigan (1921-2016) was a renowned peace activist, Jesuit priest, prolific author, and poet-in-residence at Fordham University in New York City. His other books include&nbsp;<i>Daniel: Under the Siege of the Divine</i>,<i>&nbsp;Uncommon Prayer: A Book of Psalms</i>, and a volume edited by John Dear entitled&nbsp;<i>Daniel Berrigan: Essential Writings</i>, part of the Modern Spiritual Masters Series.<b>Jim Wallis</b><br> &#x2014; President of Sojourners<br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>The Great Awakening</i><br> "Part biblical commentary, part poetry, and part prophecy &#x2014; this is Berrigan at his best."<br><br><b>Andrew Greeley</b><br> &#x2014; priest, popular author, social critic<br> "In this powerful and disturbing meditation on the books of Kings, Father Daniel Berrigan, with all his usual prophetic fervor and scalding wit, compares Israel in the time between David and Isaiah with the United States today. The implications may keep you awake at night."<br><br><b>Joan Chittister</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>Welcome to the Wisdom of the World</i><br> "Daniel Berrigan's&nbsp;<i>Kings and Their Gods</i>&nbsp;is not one book but three. The first book in question is scripture's two books of Kings, which most people ignore. The second book is Berrigan's own poetic, piercing interpretation of the books of Kings. The third book is about us &#x2014; our country, our times, ourselves. In each case, the language is elegant and the narrative is dramatic and chilling. Most of all, Berrigan's interpretation is disturbingly real, frighteningly true. My advice is to read this book with the scripture in one hand and the newspaper in the other. But whatever you do,&nbsp;<i>read</i>&nbsp;it. Once you do, you'll never think of the books of Kings as useless history again. On the contrary, you may think of them all the time."<br><br><b>David James Duncan</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>The Brothers K</i><br> "I can think of few men I admire so much, yet am so grateful not to be, as Daniel Berrigan. This man's life has been given to dark witness. Working with his back to the sun, delving in the shadows of earthly power, he has self-abnegatingly pinned tails on the donkeys and elephants of American Empire for half a century. Some find truth via fear of God, some via love for God. Grateful as I am to count myself among the latter, I thank this poet-hero of the former. Father Berrigan's life has been a tireless song of protest against all that Love cannot bear."<br><br><b>Eugene H. Peterson</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>The Message</i><br> "Stunning. Irreverent. Incisive. This bold Berrigan midrash on the books of Kings brings the American way into prophetic biblical focus. Won't we ever learn? But with Dan Berrigan among us, we are not without a witness."<br><br><b><i>Word &amp; World</i></b><br> &#x201c;A highly readable, winsome, and accessible pastoral offering.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Cistercian Studies Quarterly</i></b><br> &#x201c;Daniel Berrigan brings his own prophetic life, his gift for poetry, and his knowledge of Scripture to bear on these two ancient history books with an agonizing honesty that calls forth a similar honesty in the reader.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Mennonite Brethren Herald</i></b><br> &#x201c;Berrigan&#x2019;s skillful use of words and brilliant turns of phrase make this commentary a joy to read. . . . An outstanding work.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Last Trial</h2><p><b>In this explosive legal thriller from <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Scott Turow, two formidable men collide: a celebrated criminal defense lawyer at the end of his career and his lifelong friend, a renowned doctor accused of murder.</b><br><br>At 85 years old, Alejandro "Sandy" Stern, a brilliant defense lawyer with his health failing but spirit intact, is on the brink of retirement. But when his old friend Dr. Kiril Pafko, a former Nobel Prize winner in Medicine, is faced with charges of insider trading, fraud, and murder, his entire life's work is put in jeopardy, and Stern decides to take on one last trial.<br><br>In a case that will provide the defining coda to both men's accomplished lives, Stern probes beneath the surface of his friend's dazzling veneer as a distinguished cancer researcher. As the trial progresses, Stern will question everything he thought he knew about his friend. Despite Pafko's many failings, is he innocent of the terrible charges laid against him? How far will Stern go to save his friend, and--no matter the trial's outcome--will he ever know the truth? Stern's duty to defend his client and his belief in the power of the judicial system both face a final, terrible test in the courtroom, where the evidence and reality are sometimes worlds apart.<br> Full of the deep insights into the spaces where the fragility of human nature and the justice system collide, Scott Turow's <i>The Last Trial</i> is a masterful legal thriller that unfolds in page-turning suspense--and questions how we measure a life.<br></p><p>Scott Turow is the author of eleven bestselling works of fiction, including <i>Identical</i>, <i>Innocent</i>, <i>Presumed Innocent</i>, and <i>The Burden of Proof</i>, and two nonfiction books, including <i>One L</i>, about his experience as a law student.

In this addition to the series, Joseph Mangina offers a constructive ecclesiology for the role and mission of the church in the twenty-first century formed by a close examination of Revelation.</p><p>"Mangina leads his readers Beatrice-like through the strange topography of the Apocalypse, helping us to rediscover it as a place where heaven traffics with earth, and imaginations conspire to tell the truth of the God of the gospel. Such deft theological reading should embolden preachers in our day to proclaim John's unsettling vision for what it is--a vivid witness to Jesus Christ fit to console, admonish, and summon the church amidst God's remaking of the world."--<b>Philip Ziegler</b>, University of Aberdeen<br><br>"Another lucidly written, theologically profound volume in what is emerging as a great commentary series. Mangina shows that Revelation is not an otherworldly book; it is a prophetic challenge and source of wisdom addressed to the church in this and every age. His learned study draws on centuries of theological thought (and also artistic interpretations), yet it is filled with fresh and often surprising insights. Mangina's work is useful--even inspiring--for contemporary theology and ministry."--<b>Ellen F. Davis</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"Neither a book of resentment nor a symbolic work that needs decoding, Revelation is presented here as an 'apocalyptic haggadah.' Mangina's splendid commentary offers a rich theological interpretation drawing on liturgy, hymnody, creeds, and artistic depictions that invite us not only into the book of Revelation but also into the life of its true author, the Holy Trinity."--<b>D. Stephen Long</b>, Marquette University<br><br>"In this richly rewarding commentary, Mangina keeps his eye trained on the most important question we can ask about Revelation: how is this weirdest, most beguiling biblical book about the Triune God?"--<b>Lauren F. Winner</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"This well-written, literate, and illuminating commentary on a classically obscure text is at once theologically astute and ecclesiastically up building--a rare combination indeed. I gladly commend it to scholars and teachers, preachers and laypeople alike."--<b>Travis Kroeker</b>, McMaster UniversityThe Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible enlists leading theologians to read and interpret scripture creedally for the twenty-first century, just as the church fathers, the Reformers, and other orthodox Christians did for their times and places. <i>Revelation</i>, like each commentary in the series, is designed to serve the church--providing a rich resource for preachers, teachers, students, and study groups--and demonstrate the continuing intellectual and practical viability of theological interpretation of the Bible.<br><br><b>Praise for Revelation in the Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible<br><br></b>"Joseph Mangina has sat patiently with every twist and turn in the Apocalypse. Drawing on conversation partners as diverse as Tolkien, Dylan, and Bonhoeffer, Mangina has produced a fine, rich commentary, one that not only instructs us about the Apocalypse but also urges us to listen to this vision as never before."--<b>Beverly Roberts Gaventa</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary <br><br>"We have many splendid commentaries already on Revelation--do we need another one? Mangina's fine work elicits an emphatic 'yes!' His wide-ranging literary imagination and deep grounding in the apocalyptic worldview of New Testament theology has resulted in an astonishingly fresh presentation. This superb commentary will stimulate the best thinking of preachers and pastors, especially those who take a lively interest in the intersection of biblical theology and geopolitics.

Drawing on documents translated from the colonial Dutch as well as maps, architectural drawings, and English-language sources, Janny Venema paints a lively picture of everyday life in colonial America.<br><br>In 1652, Petrus Stuyvesant, director general of New Netherland, established a court at Fort Orange, on the west side of New York State&#x2019;s upper Hudson River. The area within three thousand feet of the fort became the village of Beverwijck. From the time of its establishment until 1664, when the English conquered New Netherland and changed the name of the settlement to Albany, Beverwijck underwent rapid development as newly wealthy traders, craftsmen, and other workers built houses, roads, bridges, and a school, as well as a number of inns. A well-organized system of poor relief also helped less wealthy settlers survive in the harsh colonial conditions. Venema&#x2019;s careful research shows that although Beverwijck resembled villages in the Dutch Republic in many ways, it quickly took on features of the new, &#x201c;American&#x201d; society that was already coming into being.</p><p>Beverwijck explores the rich history and Dutch heritage of one of North America's oldest cities&#x2014;Albany, New York.

They&#x2019;re free to do other things like enjoy an active sex life. This no-nonsense guide helps mothers-to-be maintain intimacy through all three trimesters and beyond. Using the real-life experience of one author and the professional expertise of the other, it covers a wide range of issues regarding sex and pregnancy, including the unanswered, difficult, and taboo questions and topics most people are afraid to address. It also helps partners develop new ways of communicating that help pregnant women relish life&#x2019;s deepest expression of sexual union. With warmth and encouragement, it prepares women for the sexual challenges and joys of pregnancy and motherhood, giving them confidence and the tools they need to enjoy it all with verve, humor, grace, and joy.</p><p><br>"Unique in sex-advice lit and highly recommended...Hardly erotic-minded, the average mama-to-be is assumed to be throwing up, not putting out.

Their lively and sassy manual an OB-GYN contributed comments and vetted the medical material discusses each trimester separately: what to expect physically, positions and techniques, non-penetration options, tuning in with one&#x2019;s partner, and coping with fatigue and competing priorities. Throughout, safety concerns turn up repeatedly and appropriately, e.g., preggie sex no-nos, when to be concerned, and when to check with your doctor.

We see liberals and radicals, white women and women of color, rethinking gender roles and redistributing housework. They brought men into the fold, and together demanded bold policy changes to ensure job protection for pregnant women and federal support for child care. Many of the creative proposals they devised to reshape the workplace and rework government policy&#x2015;such as guaranteed incomes for mothers and flex time&#x2015;now seem prescient.</p><p>Swinth definitively dispels the notion that second-wave feminists pushed women into the workplace without offering solutions to issues they faced at home. <i>Feminism&#x2019;s Forgotten Fight</i> examines activists&#x2019; campaigns for work and family in depth, and helps us see how feminism&#x2019;s opponents&#x2015;not feminists themselves&#x2015;blocked the movement&#x2019;s aspirations. Her insights offer key lessons for women&#x2019;s ongoing struggle to achieve equality at home and work.</p></p><p>Kirsten Swinth is Associate Professor of History and American Studies at Fordham University and the author of <i>Painting Professionals: Women Artists and the Development of Modern American Art, 1870&#x2013;1930</i>.&#x201c;Chronicles in careful detail the efforts by feminist activists both male and female to remold the structures of family and work life that had historically contributed to a thankless and even punishing existence for most women.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ashley Fetters</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Atlantic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Explores how and why our society is structured to make motherhood so hard...

You have met your match in this sweeping, very readable book which recovers the lost feminist vision that equality requires structural transformation of both work and family to become real. Kirsten Swinth shows not only that &#x2018;having it all&#x2019; was a myth but that &#x2018;second wave&#x2019; feminists were not responsible for selling such an impossible dream to U.S. women during the last third of the twentieth century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eileen Boris, coauthor of <i>Caring for America: Home Health Workers in the Shadow of the Welfare State</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Have it all&#x2019; was a marketers&#x2019; slogan, not a feminist one. Instead, as Swinth describes in rich detail, women&#x2019;s groups thoughtfully debated how to reorganize personal relationships and work arrangements in ways that were fair to women, men, children, and families of different racial and economic backgrounds. We might do well to revisit some of their ideas.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephanie Coontz, author of <i>A Strange Stirring: </i>The Feminine Mystique<i> and American Women at the Dawn of the 1960s</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Swinth reveals the &#x2018;having it all&#x2019; myth for what it truly is&#x2015;a backlash against feminism masquerading as feminism. In its place, she unearths what feminists actually fought for, and sometimes, against great odds, achieved. Her brilliant reconstruction of the wide-ranging activism of 1960s and 1970s feminists rescues their work from contemporary parodies and enables it to serve, once again, as a template for the fairer world that we may yet achieve.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Beryl Satter, author of <i>Family Properties: Race, Real Estate, and the Exploitation of Black Urban America</i></b></p><h2>The Eternity War: Pariah (The Eternity War, 1)</h2><p><b>The first novel in a brand-new series from rising SF star Jamie Sawyer, <i>The Eternity War: Pariah</i> is an action-packed adventure set in the same universe as his acclaimed Lazarus War novels. </b><br>The soldiers of the Simulant Operations Programme are mankind's elite warriors.

Some scholars say that China is invulnerable to religion. Some say that past efforts of missionaries have failed, writing off those who were converted as nothing more than &#x201c;rice Christians,&#x201d; or cynical souls who had frequented the missions for the benefits they provided. Some wonder if the Cultural Revolution extinguished any chances of Christianity in China.<br><br> Rodney Stark and Xiuhua Wang offer a different perspective, arguing that Christianity is alive, well, and even on the rise. Stark approaches the topic from an extensive research background in both Christianity and Chinese history, and Wang provides an inside look at Christianity and its place in her home country of China. Both authors cover the history of religion in China, disproving older theories concerning not only the number of Christians, but the kinds of Christians that have emerged in the past 155 years. &nbsp;Stark and Wang claim that when just considering the visible Christians, those not part of underground churches, there are still thousands of Chinese being converted to Christianity each day, and forty new churches opening each week.<br><br><i>A Star in the East</i> draws on two major national surveys to sketch a close-up of religion in China. A reliable estimate is that by 2007 there were approximately 60 million Christians in China. If the current rate of growth were to hold until 2030, there would be more Christians in China&#x2014;about 295 million&#x2014;than in any other nation on earth. This has significant implications, not just for China but for the greater world order. It is probable that Chinese Christianity will splinter into denominations, likely leading to the same kinds of political, social, and economic ramifications seen in the West today.<br><br> Whether you&#x2019;re new to studying Christianity in China, or whether this has been your area of interest for years, <i>A Star in the East </i>provides a reliable, thought-provoking, and engaging account of the resilience of the Christian faith in China and the implications it has for the future.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rodney Stark </b>is the Distinguished Professor of the Social Sciences and Co-Director of the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University and Honorary Professor of Sociology at Peking University in Beijing.

And contrary to theories that reduce religion to consolation for the poor and marginal, Stark and Wang find that Chinese Christianity is more favored by the affluent and well-educated.&nbsp; This book is a valuable addition to the growing effort to understand Christianity&#x2019;s rise in China.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014; Joel Carpenter, Nagel Institute for the Study of World Christianity, Calvin College<br><br> &#x201c;Books on contemporary China have proliferated in recent years, and plenty of them address the remarkable growth of Christianity.

Yet the Bard's "cubism of the theater," his curious splicing of verse and prose, ought to resonate with meaning for us today. Here the well-known director explains the rationale behind his controversial productions of King Lear and Romeo and Juliet. This tapestry of essays, notes and manifestos includes a section on the international, multicultural theater group Brook organized in Paris to reinvent the sounds, gestures and scripts that he feels should animate true theater. He relives the group's three-month journey in Africa, which led to his mounting The Conference of the Birds. Another play in which ceremony and performance fuse, Brook's re-creation of the Indian epic Mahabharata, is also discussed. Several pieces on opera explore ways to revive what he considers an artificial, stagnant form. With its far-reaching perspective on avant-garde and classical theater, this journal will reward even readers who are not familiar with the works discussed. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Frederick Douglass in Washington, D.C.: The Lion of Anacostia (American Heritage)</h2><p>The remarkable journey of Frederick Douglass from fugitive slave to famed orator and author is well recorded. Yet little has been written about Douglass&#39;s final years in Washington, D.C.

The ever-active Douglass was involved in local politics, from aiding in the early formation of Howard University to editing a groundbreaking newspaper to serving as marshal of the District. During this time, his wife of forty-four years, Anna Murray, passed away, and eighteen months later, he married Helen Pitts, a white woman. Unapologetic for his controversial marriage, Douglass continued his unabashed advocacy for the rights of African Americans and women and his belief in American exceptionalism.

His stated purpose at the time was to bring together a miscellany of deeply appreciated but scattered verse. <p>Beginning with the work of Paul Laurence Dunbar, who, though there were black poets before him, is generally credited as the first black poet to make a deep impression on the literary world, the book includes the writings of James Weldon Johnson, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jessie Faucet, Sterling A. Brown, Arna Bontemps, Langston Hughes, and Countee Cullen himself, to name only a few. </p><p>Each poem includes poignant biographical notes written by the poets themselves, with the exception of the notes on Dunbar (written by his wife), Joseph S. Cotter, Jr. (written by his father), and Lula Weeden (written by her mother). </p><p>Most of the poets became well known and widely published in the years that followed. These poems remain powerful statements of what it means to be human, whatever the race. </p><p>Long out of print, "Caroling Dusk" is a valuable addition to the body of black literature. This is the first time the anthology has appeared in a paperback edition.</p></p><p>Cullen was born in New York City, educated in New York's public schools, received his B.A. from New York University, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and went to Harvard for his M.A.<br><br>Cullen was born in New York City, educated in New York's public schools, received his B.A. from New York University, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and went to Harvard for his M.A.Long out of print, this anthology--featuring work by figures such as W.E.B.

A man used to getting what he wants, Elliot is every woman&#x2019;s most secret fantasy in the living flesh.<br><br>He first appears beneath her prison window as her savior&#x2014;a sinfully attractive man whose charm and connections have ensured her release from an unjust arrest. But author and publisher Phaedra Blair quickly learns that the price of her &#x201c;freedom&#x201d; is to be virtually bound to her irresistible rescuer. For Elliot Rothman didn&#x2019;t come solely on a mission of goodwill. He came to extract a promise that Phaedra won&#x2019;t publish a slanderous manuscript that could destroy his family&#x2019;s name, and he&#x2019;s not above bribery, threats, or bedding her to get his way. And with each erotic encounter raising the stakes between them, Elliot discovers he&#x2019;s ever more reluctant to lose this sensual game...or the one woman who&#x2019;s every bit his match.</p><p>Madeline Hunter is a nationally bestselling author of historical romances who lives in Pennsylvania with her husband and two sons. In a parallel existence to the one she enjoys as a novelist, she has a Ph.D. in art history and teaches at an East Coast university.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>A man who has committed a crime needs to cover his tracks, even if he made them while wearing the best shoes that money can buy.<br><br>In order to cover his, Lord Elliot Rothwell reentered his family's London home amidst the late arrivals to his brother's ball. He acted like a young man who had briefly gone out to take some air on this glorious, breezy May night. <br><br>With one step over the threshold he no longer entered but instead greeted. The tall, handsome, youngest brother of the fourth Marquess of Easterbrook&#x2014;the Rothwell sibling considered the most amiable and normal&#x2014;bestowed smiles on everyone and very warm ones on certain ladies. <br><br>A quarter hour later Elliot slid into a conversation with Lady Falrith as smoothly as he had just slipped back into the ballroom. He resumed a topic aborted two hours earlier, and flattered the lady so adroitly that she forgot that he had excused himself long ago. Within minutes Lady Falrith ceased to care about the passage of time.<br><br>While Elliot charmed Lady Falrith he scanned the crush in the ballroom for his brother. Not his brother Hayden, who along with his new wife, Alexia, was hosting this ball. He sought the eye of his other brother, Christian, Marquess of Easterbrook.<br><br>Christian's gaze never met his but Elliot's return to the ball was noted. Christian disengaged from a circle of lords on the far side of the room and walked to the door. <br><br>Elliot danced a waltz with Lady Falrith before continuing this night's mission. He did so in penance for using the lady, and in silent thanks for her unwitting aid. Lady Falrith's sense of time could be fluid, and her memory very optimistic. By the morning she would believe that Elliot had attended on her all night and was in pursuit of her. Her confidence in her own appeal would prove useful should something untoward develop regarding his activities in the city tonight.<br><br>The waltz over, he again excused himself. Unlike Christian, who had walked in isolation and with purpose for the door, Elliot strolled down the ballroom sociably, greeting and chatting until he sidled next to his new sister-in-law, Alexia.<br><br>"It is going well, don't you agree?" she asked. Her gaze swept the chamber, seeking empirical confirmation. <br><br>"It is a triumph, Alexia." And it was, for her. A triumph of spirit and character, and maybe a triumph of love. <br><br>Alexia was not the sort of woman whom society had expected Hayden to marry. She had no family and no fortune. She was so sensible that she had never learned how to dissemble, let alone flirt. Yet here she was hosting a grand ball in the home of a marquess, her dark hair impeccably styled and her headdress and garments the last word in fashion. The penniless orphan had married a man who loved her in a way he had never loved before.<br><br>Elliot trusted the marriage would be a good one. Alexia would see to that. History had proven that love was a dangerous emotion for Rothwell men. Sensible, practical Alexia would know how to use the love to keep the danger corralled, however. Elliot suspected that she had already tamed the beast several times.<br><br>He joined her in admiring the night's success. In the far corner a small, pale woman held court. One too many plumes flourished in the headdress decorating her blonde hair. All the while she kept one gleaming eye on the male attention being paid to a pretty girl nearby.<br><br>"The triumph is yours, Alexia, but I think that my aunt intends to take home the biggest prize this hunting season." <br><br>"Your aunt Henrietta is understandably happy about Caroline's first season. Two titles have paid addresses of late. However, she is vexed with me tonight because I did not invite one of those titles to this ball, despite her command to do so."<br><br>Elliot had little interest in his aunt's vexations. He did, however, have a strong interest in the guest list.<br><br>"I have not seen Miss Blair, Alexia. No black habits. No undressed hair. Did Hayden forbid you to invite her?"<br><br>"Not at all. Phaedra is abroad. She embarked over a fortnight ago."<br><br>He did not want to appear too curious, but . . . "Abroad, you say?"<br><br>Her violet eyes warmed with humor. She gave him all of her attention, which, considering the subject, he would rather not have.<br><br>"Naples first, then a tour of the south. I told her that you say it is unwise to visit Italy in the heat of summer, but she spoke of desiring to investigate the rituals and feasts of that season." She inclined her head confidentially. "I believe that her father's passing affected her more than she admits. Her final meeting with him was an emotional one. It distressed her. I believe she undertook this voyage in order to lift her spirits."<br><br>He did not doubt a deathbed parting with a father could be emotional. His own had touched him indelibly. Tonight, however, he was more interested in Miss Blair's whereabouts, and in matters that had been discussed with her father before they made that permanent farewell.<br><br>"If you know where she planned to reside in Naples, I will call on her when I go if she is still there."<br><br>"She did leave a residence that she hoped to use. She had learned about it from a friend. If she has not returned prior to your own journey, I will be grateful if you call on her. Her independence sometimes leads to carelessness, so I do worry about her."<br><br>He doubted Phaedra Blair took well anyone's worrying about her. Alexia was very good to do so anyway.<br><br>"Oh, dear," muttered Alexia.<br><br>He saw what caused the sigh that followed. Henrietta aimed for them, her plumes dancing and her dreamy, sparkling eyes displaying glints of determination.<br><br>"I think she is after <i>you</i>," Alexia whispered. "Float away, or she will bend your ear complaining how Easterbrook permitted me to host a ball without asking for her agreement. She thinks her residence in this house makes her the mistress of it."<br><br>Elliot could float with the best of them. He was long gone downstream before his aunt arrived.<br>After a quick cut to the servants' corridor and a fast nip up the back stairs, Elliot approached Christian's chambers. He entered the sitting room to find his brother lounging in a chair in the corner. <br>The sharp look Christian shot at him proved Easterbrook's mind was not nearly as relaxed as his body.<br><br>"I did not find it," Elliot said, answering the question those dark eyes asked. "If it is in his offices or his home, it is very well hidden."<br><br>Christian audibly exhaled. The sound carried his annoyance that this matter had recently interrupted his freedom to spend his days doing whatever it was that he normally did. Elliot had no idea what those activities might be. No one really knew what Christian was about anymore. <br><br>"On knowing he was about to die, he may have burned it," Elliot suggested.<br><br>"Merris Langton displayed a character that was unlikely to think of sparing others, even when he was at death's door." Christian crooked a finger under the top of his perfectly tied cravat and gave a little yank to loosen it. <br><br>Christian appeared splendid tonight, every inch the lord of the realm. His coats and linens announced their superior quality with every thread. His gesture with the cravat hinted at his discomfort with the night's formality, however, as surely as the long queue of his unfashionably long, dark hair indicated his eccentric bent. <br><br>Elliot assumed his brother longed to shed the sartorial symbols of civilization and swathe himself in that exotic robe he often wore. One normally found him barefoot in these chambers, not wearing silk hose and pumps. Currently the only hint of his normal dishabille in the house was the unbuttoned frock coat and the liquid manner in which his tall body molded itself to the chair's upholstery.<br><br>"You checked for loose floorboards and such?" Christian asked.<br><br>"I risked discovery to do so. I was in both buildings too long, and a constable passed by as I left the City offices. It is dark, there was no lamp near the door, however . . ." <br><br>His description of his adventure suggested more caution than he had experienced. He believed there were occasions when there was no choice except to break a law, but he had never expected to be so coldly indifferent to doing so when such an occasion arrived for him.<br><br>"You have been at this ball all night, should any questions arise," Christian said. "Langton owned a small publishing house that favored radical texts. He was also a man with a taste for blackmail, as we have learned. The pity is that he went and died before I could pay him off. Now Richard Drury's manuscript is God knows where, and its sordid lie about our father may yet see the light of day."<br><br>"I will make sure it does not."<br><br>"Do you think someone else got to it before you? I am probably not the only person Langton approached."<br><br>"I saw no indication that anyone had gone through his belongings yet. Not even his solicitor or executor. He was only buried this afternoon. I do not think it was in either place when he died."<br><br>"That is damned inconvenient."<br><br>"Inconvenient but not insurmountable. I will find it, and I will destroy it if necessary."<br><br>Christian's attention narrowed on him. "You speak with confidence. You know where that damned manuscript is, don't you?"<br><br>"I have a good idea. If I am right, we will be done with this soon. It may still cost you."<br><br>"Pay. Richard Drury was a member of Parliament and, despite his extreme views, a respected intellectual. If his memoirs include such an accusation against my father, many will believe it."<br><br><i>They will believe it because it fits with what they already think to be true</i>. Elliot did not voice the response, but it had whispered in his head since first hearing that Merris Langton planned to publish Richard Drury's posthumous memoirs. The book would include secrets and gossip that reflected badly on many of the great and powerful, both past and present. The accusation it purportedly contained about their father fit too well what society already assumed about his parents' marriage. <br><br>Society had been wrong about most of it, however. His own father had explained that to him at a moment when men do not lie.<br><br><i>You were her favorite. She kept you to herself and I allowed it since you were the youngest. It was a relief to see her remember she was a mother at times. Only now here I am dying and I barely know you. I do not expect love or grief from you, but I'll not go with you thinking I am a monster like she probably told you I am.</i><br><br>"Where do you think the manuscript is? I demand that you keep me informed every step of the way, Elliot. If you are not making progress, I will handle this myself."<br><br>It was not clear just how Christian would handle it. That ambiguity had led Elliot to take the charge on himself. His brother might be ruthless in silencing these echoes from the past.<br><br>"Although I did not find the manuscript, I did discover financial papers in Langton's office. That press is in trouble. Of more interest were documents regarding the ownership of the press. Richard Drury had been a silent partner from the start. That is no doubt why Langton received those memoirs."<br><br>Christian found that interesting. "We will have to approach Langton's solicitor and see who gets it all now."<br><br>"The documents indicated that Drury's share was bequeathed to his only child. There is a living partner still to deal with, who probably was complicit in the little blackmail scheme from the start."<br><br>"His only child? Hell." Christian pressed his head against the chair's back cushion, closed his eyes, and emitted an exasperated groan. "Not Phaedra Blair. Damnation."<br><br>"Yes, Phaedra Blair."<br><br>Christian muttered another curse. "How like Mr. Drury, with his radical views and unconventional life, to bequeath a business partnership to a woman, and his illegitimate daughter at that." His lids lowered. "Of course, she may be glad for the money if the press is in trouble. She may even welcome a reason not to publish her father's memoirs. They are no doubt full of private matters regarding her and her mother."<br><br>"Possibly." Elliot was not optimistic that negotiations would be so simple. Miss Blair was an unwelcome complication.<br><br>She might see in those memoirs and their secrets the making of a strong seller that would save that press. Or worse, she might believe her notions of social justice would be served by revealing the underbelly of polite society.<br><br>"Her own book was published by Langton, wasn't it? It is in the library here somewhere. I confess I never read it. I have little interest in mythology and folklore, let alone the syncretist studies on it," Christian said. <br><br>"I have heard that the scholarship was more than respectable." Elliot believed in giving the devil her due, as it were. "She inherited her parents' intelligence along with their indifference toward rules of conduct and conformity."<br><br>"Under the circumstances, none of her legacies is good news for us." Christian rose to his feet. He buttoned his coat and checked his collar in preparation for returning to the ball. "Best if you did not tell Hayden about any of this. He is very protective of his new wife, and Miss Blair is one of Alexia's friends. If you are obligated to get harsh it would be better if they remained ignorant." <br><br>"Miss Blair sailed for Naples two weeks ago. I will deal with her before she and Alexia can have another t�te-�-t�te."<br><br>"Will you be following her?"<br><br>"I had intended to travel there this autumn anyway. I want to study the recent excavations at Pompeii for my next book. I will move my journey forward now."<br><br>They walked side by side to the staircase. With each step the strains of music grew louder and the gentle roar of voices filled the majestic spaces. As they descended into the gay crush, Elliot noticed Christian's hooded, distracted expression. <br><br>"Do not be concerned, Christian. I will make sure that the accusation against Father is never printed."<br> <br>Christian's fleeting smile did not clear his expression. "I do not doubt your abilities or resolve. That is not what I was contemplating just now."<br><br>"Then what?"<br><br>"I was thinking about Phaedra Blair, and wondering if any man can, as you put it, deal with her."<br>Elliot walked in darkness, his way lit by the flame of the small lamp that he carried. <br><br>The guests were gone and the servants slept. Hayden and Alexia were probably enjoying the marriage bed in their house on Hill Street. Christian might still be awake but he would not leave his chambers for several days now.</p><h2>Tales from Lovecraft Middle School #4: Substitute Creature</h2><p>It's Valentine's Day and a monstrous blizzard has descended upon Lovecraft Middle School, trapping twelve-year-old Robert Arthur inside the building!

This book is not simply a guide that explains the revised texts as if we were simply changing the words we say at Mass; rather, it seizes the opportunity of the promulgation of the third edition of The Roman Missal as a valuable vehicle for liturgical catechesis.<p> Grounded in sacramental theology and the liturgical rites of the Church, respected authors Rev. Douglas Martis, sacramental theologian, seminary professor, Director of the Liturgical Institute, and Christopher Carstens, Director of the Office of Worship, LaCrosse, WI--recall for the readers that the Sacred Liturgy is safeguarded by the Church.

He is an adjunct faculty member at the Liturgical Institute and a frequent presenter in liturgical conferences and parish education. He is a member of the Society for Catholic Liturgy and is married with four children.Mystical Body, Mystical Voice is an unusually rich and thorough exploration of the meaning of the Liturgy - the signs, symbols and language of our worship, and the divine reality that animates all three. Comprehensive in their scope, engaging in their detail, the authors have created an invaluable theological resource for the Church as we welcome the implementation of the new <i>Roman Missal.</i> --Charles J. Chaput, OFM. Cap., Archbishop of Denver<br><br>Preparation for the use of a new English translation of the <i>Roman Missal</i> requires that its reception be grounded in solid liturgical and theological catechesis on the Sacred Liturgy. At the same time this preparation must revive the necessary unity between liturgical prayer and belief, and consequently the Christian life. <i>Mystical Body, Mystical Voice</i> by Christopher Carstens and Father Douglas Martis provides for both of these possibilities with a guiding resource of enduring value for diocesan and parish leaders at this unique moment of celebrating the ever-renewing Mystery of Christ with new words. --Reverend Gerald Dennis Gill, Director, Office for Worship, Archdiocese of Philadelphia<br><br><i>Mystical Body, Mystical Voice</i> offers a clear and yet theologically profound exploration of the new translation of the Mass. It will be an indispensable point of reference in the ongoing mystagogical formation of the faithful as Catholics learn to pray communally with the new translation. In these chapters, the authors offer no mere explanation of the meaning of the words of the Mass. Rather, they succeed in forming the reader with a deep sensitivity to the supernatural reality of the Mass, made accessible through sacramental words and signs. --Prof. James Pauley, STL, STD (Cand.), Assistant Professor of Theology and Catechetics, Franciscan University of Steubenville</p><h2>King of the Empty Plain: The Tibetan Iron-Bridge Builder Tangtong Gyalpo</h2><p><i>King of the Empty Plain</i> is familiar to every Tibetan yet nearly unknown in the rest of the world.

An extensive introduction discusses Tangtong Gyalpo's Dharma traditions, the question of his amazing longevity, his "crazy" activities manifested to enhance his own realization and to benefit others, and his astonishing engineering and architectural achievements. The book includes a complete translation of the most famous Tibetan biography of Tangtong Gyalpo, as well as the Tibetan text and English translation of a unique early manuscript describing his miraculous death. The text is further enriched with ten color plates and seventy-seven black-and-white illustrations.</p><p>None of Tibet's great spiritual teachers have made a deeper impact on the religious, artistic, and technological history of the country than the great adept Tangtong Gyalpo, "King of the Empty Plain" (1361?-1485). Tangtong Gyalpo's achievements in three widely different spheres--his contributions to Tibet's meditative traditions, his development of long-life techniques still practiced in Tibet, and his legacy of iron suspension bridges and other architectural monuments built throughout the country--have given rise to hundreds of stories about his life and his death. The core of the book is a complete translation of the most famous biography of Tangtong Gyalpo, a fast-paced and enthusiastically narrated account which follows Tangtong Gyalpo as he travels throughout the length and breadth of Tibet and beyond, helping the poor, giving and receiving teachings, and performing countless miracles. <p>"Tangtong Gyalpo was a unique figure in the deeply spiritual culture of Tibet. Not only was he an important spiritual master, a source of important meditation instruction lineages, he was also a master engineer who built over a hundred iron bridges across some of the deepest gorges in the world as well as a dramatist credited with the development of the classical Tibetan opera performance. In King of the Empty Plain: The Tibetan Iron-Bridge Builder Tangtong Gyalpo Cyrus Stearns, one of the most respected translators of classical Tibetan texts, beautifully brings to life the story of one of Tibet's most inspiring and loved personalities. This book is a must for anyone who is interested in Tibetan culture and history as well as those who wish to see how the altruistic ideals of the bodhisattva path can be concretely applied in socio-economic and humanitarian action."--Thupten Jinpa, translator to H.H. the Dalai Lama, author of Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy, editor of Path to Bliss, Practicing Wisdom, and Essence of the Heart Sutra </p><p>"This represents the culmination of many years of patient scholarship and contemplation of the problems of meaningful translation into English...the author has selected a figure of enormous importance for the cultural context Tibetan Buddhism. This is a book that will last."--Gene Smith, Executive Director, Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center </p><p>"Tangtong Gyalpo, the King of the Empty Plain, the famous and beloved wild engineer-saint of Tibet and Bhutan, is surely one of the most fascinating and brilliant characters ever to appear in Buddhist legend and literature. Even now he has a presence in nearly every household in Tibet, and in the west his short visionary practice of the lord of compassion is done far and wide. Cyrus Stearns has been intimately involved with the life and teachings of this great adept for over thirty years, ever since I have known him. This book embodies the fruition of that devotion, of masterful scholarship, and of an integrated understanding of the material. How fortunate that we all now have access to this great story in a worthy translation and illuminating commentary."--Sarah Harding </p><p>"This most welcome publication provides a fascinating and erudite study of the life of the great Tibetan Buddhist adept and civic engineer Tangtong Gyalpo. The author has lucidly translated Tangtong's well-known biography, which recounts the master's exceptional life as an inspired Buddhist teacher, remarkable iron-chain suspension bridge-builder, and prototype for the later nonsectarian visionaries of Tibetan religion. The biography is filled as well with an abundance of material for discerning the social history of the intersection of Buddhism, lay patronage, and daily life during Tangtong's period, all mixed in with a heady dose of hagiographical flourish. The work stands as an excellent specimen of biographical writing in this classical period of Tibetan literature. The very learned introduction provides documentation of Tangtong Gyalpo's bridge-building projects, as well as his extremely long life, and his wide travels in South and East Asia. A wonderful introduction to Tibetan religion and society for students and scholars alike!"--Janet Gyatso, Harvard University </p><p>"King of the Empty Plain is a fascinating account of the life of Tangtong Gyalpo, one of the most innovative and eclectic Tibetan masters of all times. By translating and elucidating his biography in a very readable style and in great detail, Cyrus Stearns leads us through his wide-ranging achievements, from building iron-chain bridges and architectural masterpieces, to mystical accomplishment in his personal life. He unravels some of the historical mysteries that have surrounded this master for centuries, such as how he may have lived until he was 124, but keeps his discussion deeply informed by the Tibetan tradition. An excellent work of cultural translation!"--Hildegard Diemberger, Tibetan Programme Director, University of Cambridge </p><p>A Tsadra Foundation Series book. </p><p>Cyrus Stearns is a scholar of Tibetan religion, literature, and history.

The work reprints (with the original language version and its English translation on facing pages) manuscript collections on painting and related arts dating roughly from the twelfth through seventeenth centuries.<br>The manuscripts describe oil painting practices in several Italian cities, and in France and Brussels. Most of them are recipe books, revealing the artists' methods of making, purifying, grinding, and dissolving many different kinds of pigments; of preparing wood and cloth for painting; of making inks, dyes, and glues; and much more. Although oil painting receives the primary emphasis, the treatises also cover the processes involved in making miniature paintings, mosaics, and paintings on glass, as well as those entailed in the crafts of gilding, glazing, cutting precious stones, and many others.<br>In addition to a preliminary commentary on each treatise, the author supplies an excellent introduction of almost 300 pages, in which she discusses the significant material referred to in the "recipes" and offers illuminating insights into the social history and artistic practices of the periods covered by the treatises. Also here for their comparative interest are several conversations Mrs. Merrifield held with eminent Italian art restorers, along with an introduction and a very helpful glossary defining technical terms used in the text.

In What's With Paul &amp; Women?

Going beyond 1 Timothy 2, this book covers the major issues in gender inequality with three Appendices: one on the Ephesian social world in which 1 Timothy was written, another on 1 Corinthians 14:34-36 and an extensive review of John Piper's What's the Difference? Manhood &amp; Womanhood Defined According to the Bible.

Riley dropped the F-bomb thirty-seven times while we rode the Cyclone roller coaster in Coney Island, Brooklyn. The Cyclone is very, very old.1 It is made out of wood. It sways. That&#x2019;s right. SWAYS&#x2014;as in back and forth&#x2014;just in case plummeting down a six-story drop at high speed wasn&#x2019;t enough for you. I&#x2019;m making it sound like this didn&#x2019;t worry me&#x2014;oh, it did. Just not enough to keep me off it. I had waited a long time to be tall enough (fifty-four inches!) to get on that roller coaster. So I was determined, despite being a little afraid, to take my finally four-and-a-half-foot twelve-year-old self on the oldest wooden roller coaster in the world.<br> <br>The truth is, I was more than a little afraid of going on the Cyclone. As much as I desperately wanted to ride it&#x2014;it&#x2019;s famous, after all&#x2014;I very desperately did not want to ride it alone. My parents wouldn&#x2019;t go. Heights make my dad turn green, and Mom is not a roller-coaster kind of person. Aunt Maureen&#x2014;Aunt Mo for short&#x2014;was out of the question. She gets dizzy on the merry-go-round, so that left my cousin Riley, and she is not a big fan of roller coasters either. But she was going on that thing with me&#x2014;because I was determined. The Cyclone was the reason I bugged my dad to bring us to Brooklyn during our yearly trip to Long Island to visit my cousin and aunt. I had even prewritten most of my summer essay on it!2 The assignment was almost done, too. I just needed the part where I actually rode the roller coaster. I was now absolutely, positively ready for the Cyclone! At least I thought I was until I was standing in its shadow looking up at it. It looks much smaller on the Internet.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all yours.&#x201d; My dad slapped two Cyclone tickets into my hand with a shake of his head, and I slapped one of them right into Riley&#x2019;s. Riley barely acknowledged me, staring as the roller-coaster cars climbed slowly up to the top of the first drop. Click-click-click-click. Riley was already having some serious doubts and insisted that we watch it a few more times. Metal gates and high fencing surrounded its base, making it seem like a dangerous, caged animal. Riley was sure gaping at it like it was. I wished the people riding it weren&#x2019;t screaming so loud; that wasn&#x2019;t helping either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom,&#x201d; Riley finally said, &#x201c;you should go with Nora. You said you loved roller coasters!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty years ago,&#x201d; Aunt Maureen clarified, taking a step backward, away from the ride. &#x201c;Not now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll meet you back here in half an hour,&#x201d; said my mother. &#x201c;For the record, I think you&#x2019;re both crazy.&#x201d; At that, she and my dad and aunt turned and headed toward Nathan&#x2019;s Famous, leaving us gazing up at the monster ride. It took up an entire block. It even had its own address: 1000 Surf Avenue, Brooklyn.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get a hot dog too!&#x201d; said Riley, apropos of nothing, pulling me in the direction our parents had just gone. &#x201c;I love hot dogs!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You do not love hot dogs.&#x201d; I swung her back toward the roller coaster. &#x201c;You tolerate hot dogs.&#x201d; It was true. She felt the same way about hot dogs as I do about scrambled eggs&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll eat them as a last resort, but that&#x2019;s it.<br> <br>&#x201c;But these are famous hot dogs!&#x201d; she practically sang. It was a desperate&#x2014;and lame&#x2014;argument, and she knew it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Trust me on this, Riley,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The time to eat a hot dog is not right before you get on a roller coaster.&#x201d; The clicking stopped, and we looked up again.<br> <br>Riley pointed to the four flags whipping around in the wind at the top of the roller coaster&#x2014;right above where the roller-coaster cars somehow seemed suspended for a second. &#x201c;What does it say there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see from here,&#x201d; I flat-out lied. LAST WARNING. REMAIN SEATED. Riley gasped as a train of coaster cars was suddenly let loose and roared toward the ground. The screams picked up a notch, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;How high up is that?&#x201d; Riley asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d; Second lie.3 The coaster shot around a tight curve at the bottom of the drop and headed up again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my God, how fast is that thing going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pretty fast.&#x201d; Vague lie.4<br> <br>Riley jabbed a finger at me. &#x201c;I am in charge of the seat belt. We are going to pull it so tight that it cuts off our circulation. Do you hear me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As tight as you want.&#x201d; Lie of omission.5<br> <br>&#x201c;This is going to be the scariest three minutes of my life!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It will be over in less than two!&#x201d; At last, a truth.6<br> <br>&#x201c;It better be,&#x201d; she said. We took a few steps toward the Cyclone line, but then she stopped short. &#x201c;You know what? I&#x2019;m really hot. Let&#x2019;s go swimming first.&#x201d; She grabbed my arm again and tried to pull me toward the beach. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go swimming and then we can dry off on the roller coaster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I pulled her back toward the line, a little too hard. &#x201c;We only have about twenty-five minutes left before Dad comes back. And you know he&#x2019;ll say, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s time to go, I don&#x2019;t want to sit in traffic, we have to leave,&#x2019; &#x201d; I said in my best dad voice, &#x201c;and then I&#x2019;m pretty sure he&#x2019;ll never come back to Brooklyn again and then I&#x2019;ll never get a chance to go on the Cyclone. Today is the day.&#x201d; Dad had very little car patience. He had already threatened to turn back around this morning when it took twenty minutes to find a parking spot. The spot we finally found was so far away he wasn&#x2019;t even sure if we were still in Brooklyn.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Riley!&#x201d; I was begging now. I was not above begging. &#x201c;It will be awesome!&#x201d;<br> <br>Riley eyed the cars bolting around a curve in the track. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not going to be awesome when I throw up all over you!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen to me. Remember how you didn&#x2019;t want to boogie board when we went to Bethany Beach two summers ago because the waves were too big?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Her eyes went wide. The coaster was barreling down a plunge.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you loved it, right?&#x201d; I stepped into her line of vision so she had to look at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but this is different.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>The key to keeping Riley calm was to keep her talking. If she was talking, she was good.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if I really do throw up?&#x201d; Riley asked. She was now twirling a handful of her hair into a long rope. A thick, black, kinked-up-because-her-hair-is-so-curly rope. It actually looked like something I might be able to hold on to. Not a good thought, for either of us.<br> <br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t. And stop torturing your hair,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Besides, even if you do, it won&#x2019;t gross me out, I promise!&#x201d; I vomited once after a long run. My heart was racing and it was crazy hot out, and, honestly, I wasn&#x2019;t feeling very well that morning, but I wanted to run. So, yep, right there at the end&#x2014;plehhh! I was mortified at the time, of course, but apparently, I wasn&#x2019;t the first person to puke after a long run on a hot day. I&#x2019;m pretty sure Riley wouldn&#x2019;t be the first person to puke after a roller-coaster ride either. I eyeballed the current load of passengers, looking for potential pukers. Oh God, don&#x2019;t let Riley see anybody puke when they get off this thing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re gross, Nora!&#x201d; But she did let go of her hair. &#x201c;Fine. Fine already. But you owe me a hot dog! If I throw up, you owe me two!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Deal!&#x201d; I whooped. I did not point out the painfully obvious&#x2014;that eating two hot dogs after vomiting was a lousy idea&#x2014;because I didn&#x2019;t want her thinking any more about the possibility. Riley was afraid; she might actually throw up. But Riley, being who she is, knew I really wanted to go, knew she was my only hope, and didn&#x2019;t want to disappoint me on my first&#x2014;and likely last&#x2014;visit to Coney Island, Brooklyn. That&#x2019;s the kind of cousin she is.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s get this over with already!&#x201d; All right! I knew she would come through!<br> <br>The line to get on the Cyclone was designed like a switchback trail, zigzagging back and forth to get to the front, and lucky for me, it wasn&#x2019;t very long&#x2014;less time for Riley to lose her nerve and change her mind. I have to admit my legs already felt a little shaky&#x2014;my stomach, too. Riley trailed a few steps behind me, so I waited for her to catch up. We stepped aside to let a group of kids&#x2014;who had all clearly reached the fifty-four-inch mark younger than I had&#x2014;screaming, &#x201c;First car! First car!&#x201d; dash past us. I didn&#x2019;t even want the first car, so I was happy to let them pass. We changed direction at the end of the row. Riley stopped to wave to her mother, who had changed her mind and stayed behind. She waved back&#x2014;our official send-off. I tried to pick up the pace, but the closer we got, the slower Riley walked. I grasped her hand to urge her along.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m nauseous already,&#x201d; she said with a laugh, but she was squeezing my hand really tightly. And I was glad, partly because I could keep her from bolting and partly because my own stomach was getting progressively questionable. Riley didn&#x2019;t look so hot either. But I kept right on moving, up, up, up&#x2014;ten more feet, through the turnstile, and we&#x2019;d be on the loading platform!&#x2014;so when Riley stopped short again, I almost fell backward. Riley wasn&#x2019;t looking at the platform&#x2014;she was looking at the first hill that loomed over us, five stories high. And she didn&#x2019;t look the laughing kind of scared anymore; she looked really scared. She let go of my hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not doing it,&#x201d; she said. Screams pierced the air as the cars plummeted down the first hill. &#x201c;Nope. I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d; And she turned around to leave.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chicken!&#x201d; the kids standing behind us teased.<br> <br>&#x201c;Riley&#x2014;c&#x2019;mon, we&#x2019;re almost there! You can do this, I know you can.&#x201d; I grasped her hand again, and somehow, the line shifted forward and she let me pull her through the turnstile onto the front of the loading platform. The next round of cars would be ours. Riley looked like she was going to cry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Riley, you can do this,&#x201d; I said, using my calmest voice, even though my internal voice was shrieking, Oh my God, we&#x2019;re nearly there, just do it! The cars pulled into the loading area. Some of the riders were laughing and others were yelling and cursing. One lady&#x2019;s face was drenched with sweat; she still had her eyes closed. The bars lifted and the cars started to empty. &#x201c;See?&#x201d; I waved my hand toward the outgoing riders. No pukers! &#x201c;Everybody survived!&#x201d;<br> <br>The guy who was the roller-coaster loader was tall and cute&#x2014;exactly the distraction I needed. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, gorgeous,&#x201d; he crooned, winking at Riley. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fun. Trust me.&#x201d; Then he barked at the closed-eye lady and two last kids to get off.<br> <br>&#x201c;Man, that was awesome!&#x201d; the kids exclaimed, dropping a few happy F-bombs themselves, high-fiving each other as they climbed out of the car. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get back in line!&#x201d; I raised my eyebrows at Riley, in a see, it&#x2019;s awesome way. Riley, however, was now looking over their heads at a sign to our left that read: WARNING: THE CYCLONE ROLLER COASTER IS A HIGH-IMPACT RIDE. ANY PERSON WITH BACK, NECK, OR HEART PROBLEMS SHOULD NOT RIDE THIS RIDE. NO PREGNANT PERSON SHOULD RIDE. HOLD ON WITH BOTH HANDS. It might as well have said THIS IS REALLY FAST AND DANGEROUS AND YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY THROW UP. TURN BACK! LAST CHANCE! DON&#x2019;T DO IT!<br> <br>But Cute Roller-Coaster Loading Boy came to the rescue once again. My mother says Riley is &#x201c;boy crazy,&#x201d; but she got attention whether she was looking for it or not. She was curvy with that wild, dark hair and cocoa-brown eyes and, almost always, except for right now, a megawatt smile. Loading Boy smiled at Riley and held out his hand to help her into our car&#x2014;the third one from the front. Psych! There was no way she was going to chicken out in front of him. Riley took his hand and climbed. Loading Boy did not keep his hand out for me. Riley looked offended on my behalf, but I wasn&#x2019;t there for cute Brooklyn boys; I was there for the roller coaster. &#x201c;Scooch over!&#x201d; I said. She slid to the far side. We were in!! And Riley couldn&#x2019;t get out. Success!!<br> <br>The cars around us filled quickly, with lots of giggles and excited screams. The bar came down and Riley gave it a good, hard shake to make sure it was locked. Loading Boy did the same. I guess Riley forgot about the seat belt. Then she made the sign of the cross, just like Aunt Maureen always did whenever she saw something terrible on the news or found out that somebody died. I was not sure what her mother would think of this casual use of the gesture.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; I asked, grinning at my cousin. The car lurched forward and began to slowly rise up the tracks. Click-click-click. My heart began to race. We click-click-clicked past another sign: KEEP HANDS ON BAR. THIS MEANS DO NOT PUT HANDS UP.<br> <br>Riley dropped her first F-bomb. To be fair, she wasn&#x2019;t the only one. Click-click-click. A chorus of profanity rose up around us. The car rose higher. A tingling feeling traveled up my legs and exploded in my stomach. I made the sign of the cross with one jittery hand, the other tightly wrapped around the safety bar.<br> <br>F-bomb, F-bomb, F-bomb from Riley as we rolled slowly up the first incline. Another sign. FINAL WARNING. REMAIN SEATED. The car rose higher. The flags we had seen from the ground whipped and waved wildly above our heads. Another heavy click sound and we were suddenly suspended at a steep, terrifying angle, gravity practically plastering me to the seat, reminding me how much my body preferred solid ground. Slowly we rose again, our car finally teetering at the top, and then we plunged. Plunged. My hair went wild, my face flattened by the pressure and speed of the drop. On the first sharp turn, Riley&#x2019;s body weight shifted, smashing me against the metal wall of the car, adding to the violent sensations of shaking and rattling that were already flooding my body.<br> <br>&#x201c;AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!&#x201d; I screamed without choice. And I couldn&#x2019;t stop screaming. Not for one minute, fifty seconds. I was doing it! I was riding the Cyclone! I was riding the oldest, shakiest roller coaster in the world! And just like that, the cars slowed as we approached the loading platform&#x2014;it was done.<br> <br>The bar flipped up. Cute Roller-Coaster Loading Boy helped Riley out of the car, and I, thank you very much, got myself out. I held on to Riley as soon as her feet hit the platform to steady myself. We went down the ramp hand in hand and only let go of each other just long enough to pass through the bright red revolving-door exit gate. The crowd of nonriders, mostly parents&#x2014;mine, Riley&#x2019;s, the other kids&#x2019;&#x2014;were walking toward us, all grinning from ear to ear. My legs were still wobbly, my adrenaline still pumping, I was light-headed&#x2014;and even a little nauseous. It felt just like crossing the finish line of the Bull Run Invitational cross-country meet (minus the vomit!). Riley held up her phone to take our selfie with the Cyclone behind us. We were arm in arm again and all smiles.<br> <br>Awesome, right? Except it wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Because after we got off the Cyclone&#x2014;after all the researching, writing, footnoting, begging, whining, Loading Boy smiles, sign-of-the-cross-ing, body smashing, and F-bombing, and immediately after the flash went off on her pink phone&#x2014;my thirteen-year-old cousin, Riley, slipped through my arm and collapsed at my feet.<br> <br>1&nbsp;Calvin Coolidge was president when the Cyclone was built. It was 1927. TWENTY-SEVEN! And Calvin Coolidge sounds like a made-up name. But it isn&#x2019;t. While we are at it, Ulysses (YOU-LIS-EES) also sounds like a made-up name. Isn&#x2019;t. And honestly, to me, Barack Obama sounded a little made up, but only because it was new to me.<br> <br>2&nbsp;Footnotes and all; with the lackluster title of &#x201c;The Reeves Family Summer Vacation.&#x201d;<br> <br>3&nbsp;Eighty-five feet.<br> <br>4&nbsp;Sixty mph.<br> <br>5&nbsp;No seat belts, just a lap bar.</p><h2>The Body in the Bouillon: A Faith Fairchild Mystery</h2><p>Murder Served Piping Hot<p></p> <p>Minister's wife, sometime sleuth, and culinary artist Faith Sibley Fairchild is intrigued by rumors of mysterious doings at Hubbard House -- an elegant, secluded retirement home for the well-heeled Yankees of Aleford, Massachusetts. Determined to do some surreptitious snooping, she joins the pricey retreat's flu-depleted kitchen staff, only to witness an aging resident collapse face-first into a bowl of Faith's hot and savory bouillon. But it isn't until a blackmailing drug dealer turns up dead in Faith's bedroom that the amateur investigator realizes that Murder not only happens at Hubbard, it's the specialty of the house! And Faith's own demise might very well be the next item on the menu.</p></p><p><p>Katherine Hall Page is the author of twenty-three previous Faith Fairchild mysteries, the first of which received the Agatha Award for best first mystery. <em>The Body in the Snowdrift</em> was honored with the Agatha Award for best novel of 2006. Page also won an Agatha for her short story &#x201c;The Would-Be Widower.&#x201d; The recipient of the Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement, she has been nominated for the Edgar, the Mary Higgins Clark, the Maine Literary, and the Macavity Awards. She lives in Massachusetts and Maine with her husband.</p>Here, spunky New England minister's wife Faith Fairchild (The Body in the Kelp, The Body in the Belfry)--while volunteering at a posh retirement facility under the aegis of venerable Dr. Roland Hubbard--barely has time to introduce herself before an old-timer falls face down into a cup of soup that she brings him. Then when a severe snowstorm forces Faith to stay the night, Eddie the groundskeeper/drug-dealer is waiting in her bed--dead. Despite warnings from husband Tom and best friend Pix, Faith persists in snooping--and discovers: several of Eddie's blackmail victims; a resident kleptomaniac; a philandering wife; and the black sheep Hubbard son, James, who quickly becomes a hit-and-run statistic. A final confrontation with the murderer will find Faith scurrying around the Hubbard House grounds just as Tom drives up. Not very plausible, and the author's strengths--genteel satire and wry humor--are not much in evidence here. Still, those in search of mild-mannered amateur-sleuthing might appreciate the nosy Faith (and enjoy her catering touches, too). -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The Tlingits saw themselves as victors even as they formally ceded to the Russians the site of their village and fort, now knows as Sitka. This book covers the period from the first arrival of European and American fur traders in Tlingit territory to the establishment of a permanent Russian presence in the Pacific Northwest. It presents transcriptions and English translations of Tlingit oral traditions recorded almost fifty years ago and translations of newly available Russian historical documents. Although independent in origin and transmission, these accounts support one another to a remarkable degree on the main historical point.<br><br>The Tlingit-Russian conflict is usually presented as a confrontation between "whites" with superior arms, and brave but outnumbered and poorly armed Natives. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Tlingits saw themselves as victors even as they formally ceded to the Russians the site of their village and fort, now known as Sitka. Setting aside ancient rules of story ownership, a new generation of Tlingit clan leaders has decided to publish the stories told by their ancestors so that the Tlingit point of view would be known and succeeding generations would not forget their people's history.<br><br>Including Russian historical documents, travelers' accounts of information interactions between the formerly warring parties after the battles, and Dr. W.

Learning is not in itself a problem. Rather, it is the arrogance and the self-inflation that the learned person derives from his knowledge. For it is clearly impossible to reach true contemplation except through humility, as the Apostle teaches (1 Cor 3:18). For if anyone, he says, seems wise in this world, he must become a fool in order to be wise. In other words, he should take on humble understanding and consider himself a fool with regard to God's wisdom. From The Mountain of Contemplation [2] <p>Jean Gerson (1363-1429), chancellor of the University of Paris from 1395 until his death, was one of the outstanding theologians and preachers of his time. Today he is all but forgotten, except in terms of his role in resolving the schism of the Western Church. Gerson deserves to be seen as a man of great passion and learning. He sought to map the path to the contemplative life in a way that made it accessible to groups outside the universities. Partly because of continuing closeness to members of his family, especially his sisters, Gerson insisted on writing many of his works in French. His Mountain of Contemplation is a major event in the history of language and in terms of gender relations in the religious life. Gerson knew how innovative his approach was, for he opened his treatise with the words: "Some persons will wonder and ask why, in a matter so lofty as that of the contemplative life, I choose to write in French rather than in Latin, and more to women than to men." </p><p>Thanks to Gerson's personal letters, translated here for the first time, it is possible to get close to the doubts and pain of a man who sought the vision of god and yearned for affective bonds. Gerson's life and writings can be seen as a search for unity in the midst of a rich and chaotic age whose spirituality we are only now beginning to appreciate. In giving advice to confessors, attacking the Romance of the Rose, preaching on the feast of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, discerning between true and false revelations, and in outlining his Practical Mystical Theology, Gerson emerges as one of the most articulate voices of a Christian spirituality that transcends the Middle Ages and speaks to our time.</p></p><p>Brian Patrick McGuire, who holds a D.Phil. from Oxford, is professor of medieval history at Roskilde University in Denmark.

The essays section contains chapters discussing such concepts as having a plan, choosing your game, playing according to your bankroll, the three levels of expert poker, middle-round strategy, what your opponent reads you for, the protected pot, saving the last bet, extra outs, how to play a tournament, and many others. The razz section will show you how the experts play this form of poker. Not only are the rules and structure of the game discussed, but advice is also given on how to play the first three cards, as well as all the other streets. In addition, a chapter of razz problems is provided, plus questions and answers to help keep your game sharp.</p><p>David Sklansky is generally considered the number one authority on gambling in the world today. Besides his ten books on the subject, David also has produced two videos and numerous writings for various gaming publications. His occasional poker seminars always receive an enthusiastic reception, including those given at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. <p>More recently, David has been doing consulting work for casinos, Internet gaming sites, and gaming device companies. He has recently invented several games, soon to appear in casinos. </p><p>David attributes his standing in the gambling community to three things: </p><p>1. The fact that he presents his ideas as simply as possible (sometimes with Mason Malmuth) even though these ideas frequently involve concepts that are deep, subtle, and not to be found elsewhere. </p><p>2. The fact that the things he says and writes can be counted on to be accurate. </p><p>3. The fact that to this day a large portion of his income is still derived from gambling (usually poker, but occasionally blackjack, sports betting, horses, video games, casino promotions, or casino tournaments). </p><p>Thus, those who depend on David&#x2019;s advice know that he still depends on it himself.</p></p><h2>Jack and Jill Went Up to Kill: A Book of Zombie Nursery Rhymes</h2><p>Michael P.

Sandra was twenty-nine years old with dark hair and blue eyes, an excellent helicopter pilot beginning her third tour in the Middle East. They watched as a six-man team of US Army Rangers ran through a training exercise, rehearsing a night raid &#x201c;snatch &#x2019;n&#x2019; grab&#x201d; presently set for the following week. Sandra and Mitchell were both Night Stalkers, pilots of the elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), which routinely operated with both Army and Naval Special Forces. Known throughout the Spec-Ops community as the best of the best, they were the go-to badasses in the air for the go-to badasses on the ground, and Sandra was the first female pilot to be made a member.<br> <br>The Rangers were maneuvering through a flimsy plywood village mock-up, working out the timing of their attack. The rehearsal site was considered &#x201c;secure&#x201d; as it was located fifty miles from the lines (to the extent that &#x201c;lines&#x201d; even existed in this godforsaken place). The snatch &#x2019;n&#x2019; grab was to be carried out against a Muslim cleric named Aasif Kohistani living in a small village in the north of Nangarhar Province. Kohistani was the leader of an Islamist political party called the Hezb-e Islami Khalis (the HIK). The HIK was gaining political influence in the Afghan parliament, and recent intelligence reports indicated that Kohistani was now working with the Taliban to consolidate his growing military power in and around Nangarhar Province in the face of the scheduled American drawdown.<br> <br>Obviously, American forces would not be able to make their scheduled drawdown work if the HIK and Taliban forces began a resurgence, so it was necessary to remove Kohistani from the picture, lest he become as strong as the already troublesome Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who lead the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin faction (HIG) based out of the Shok Valley of the Hindu Kush. Both the HIK and the HIG had made significant gains in parliamentary influence over the past year, and both were violently opposed to Afghan-US relations.<br> <br>Sandra flicked away the smoking butt of her cigarette and lay back on the deck of the helicopter to close her eyes, smiling pleasantly to herself. She and the Ranger team leader, Captain Sean Bordeaux, had secretly hooked up the night before back at the air base outside of Jalalabad. It had been a much-needed tryst for both of them, each of their military spouses being stationed on the other side of the world. Six months was a long time for anyone to go without, but the nature of their respective jobs was extremely stressful, and this stress had long been exacerbated by the uncommonly strong attraction between them&#x2014;which was no one&#x2019;s fault but that of Mother Nature. The sexual tension between them was now dispelled, however, and both of them were thinking much more clearly, able to focus their full attention on their respective missions.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, have you heard from Beth?&#x201d; Sandra asked.<br> <br>Mitchell sat squinting into the morning sun, watching as the Rangers retook their positions to begin another &#x201c;infiltration&#x201d; of the village. He and Sandra were the only security for the training op. He drew pensively from his cigarette, thinking of his wife who was due to give birth in less than a week.<br> <br>&#x201c;Last night,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;She said she could pop any minute. Could be happening right now, for all I know. How come you and John don&#x2019;t have any kids?&#x201d;<br> <br>She lifted her head to look at him. &#x201c;Do I look like I&#x2019;m ready to have kids?&#x201d;<br> <br>He laughed. &#x201c;Well, I guess it&#x2019;s a little different with you guys.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can say that,&#x201d; she said, rising up onto her elbows. &#x201c;I mean, we only see each other about four months of the year. Sometimes, I wonder why we even&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Machine gun fire raked the front of the Black Hawk, and bullets went whining off into the air.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the fuck!&#x201d; Mitchell said, grabbing up his M4. &#x201c;Enemy front!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Incoming!&#x201d; one of the Rangers screamed from the far side of the ersatz village.<br> <br>The first couple of mortars struck the ground, their telltale crumping sounds ripping through the air. Two more rounds quickly fell, and the flimsy buildings blew apart like houses made from playing cards. The nearest pair of Rangers leapt back to their feet and came sprinting toward the Black Hawk. Another round dropped just in front of them and they vanished.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus Christ!&#x201d; Sandra scrambled into the cockpit. &#x201c;Where the fuck did they come from? We&#x2019;re in the middle of fucking nowhere.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We gotta get this bitch off the ground.&#x201d; Mitchell was climbing into the gunner&#x2019;s compartment behind her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a sitting fucking duck here!&#x201d;<br> <br>The four remaining Rangers were still a hundred yards off across the village, running hard for the chopper as Sandra flipped the switches in the cockpit and the rotors began to turn. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be airborne in sixty seconds.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have sixty&#x2014;!&#x201d;<br> <br>A mortar struck the tail section of the helicopter, lifting the hind end of the bird into the air and causing it to slew wildly around. Mitchell was slammed against the bulkhead, splitting his head open, and Sandra was thrown from her seat to the other side of the cockpit. The sound of small arms fire filled the air. Bullets snapped through the fuselage as she tried to call for support over the radio.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fucked!&#x201d; Mitchell grabbed for her arm. &#x201c;We gotta dismount!&#x201d; A round struck him in the chest and he dropped dead to the deck.<br> <br>Captain Bordeaux leapt into the bird, grabbing Sandra&#x2019;s collar and hauling her from the aircraft against a hail of gunfire. They were both hit and fell out the open door. The other three remaining Rangers took cover as best they could near the fuselage, but it seemed they were surrounded on all sides, and the cover among the rocks was sparse at best.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you get off a call for help?&#x201d; Bordeaux asked, firing a few rounds into a coppice of trees to keep the enemy&#x2019;s head down.<br> <br>&#x201c;They took out the radio first thing,&#x201d; Sandra said, gasping against the pain in her thigh where she&#x2019;d taken a round from an AK-47. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s up against the bone, Sean. Fuck me! It hurts like a holy bastard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bordeaux grabbed up Mitchell&#x2019;s M4 and jammed it into her hands as he half-carried, half-dragged her toward the rocks where his men were digging in as best they could with the butts of their carbines. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in some deep shit here, guys. No cover and nowhere to run.&#x201d;<br> <br>One of the other men went right to work applying a pressure tourniquet to Sandra&#x2019;s leg. Shock was setting in fast and she&#x2019;d already begun to fade.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d better think of something fast,&#x201d; one of the other Rangers said. &#x201c;When they correct fire on those mortars, we&#x2019;re dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They could&#x2019;ve done that already,&#x201d; Bordeaux said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re maneuvering to take us alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or her,&#x201d; said a sergeant named Tornero.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or her, yeah.&#x201d; Bordeaux spat in disgust. Their radioman had been blasted to hell, and it would be at least another hour, maybe two, before anyone tried to raise them and thought to send another chopper. This was supposed to have been a very secure zone, which was why it had been chosen in the first place. Something was wrong. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, guys, but it feels like they were here waiting for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tornero was jamming cotton wadding into a shoulder wound. &#x201c;Yeah, well, the way they&#x2019;ve been blabbing about the op back at HQ, it don&#x2019;t fucking surprise me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like having a woman in this shit,&#x201d; Bordeaux said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you can trade me,&#x201d; Sandra groaned, fighting the urge to vomit.<br> <br>Another furious fusillade of gunfire erupted, forcing them all belly-down against the earth as the enemy maneuvered still closer.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s at least twenty!&#x201d; shouted one of the other Rangers, firing away, finally managing to kill one. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re gonna jerk the noose tight.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bordeaux knew their time had run out. It was time to surrender or break out across country, and there was no way to break out without leaving Sandra behind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sergeant, you three haul ass for that defilade!&#x201d; he ordered. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no other way. Try to fight your way north toward friendlies. Surrender&#x2019;s not an option here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tornero exchanged looks with the other two members of the team, all of them shaking their heads. He looked back at Bordeaux and grinned. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ll stay, Captain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I said haul ass!&#x201d;<br> <br>Tornero popped up just long enough to biff a grenade then ducked back down. &#x201c;You can court-martial us if we live long enough, sir, but we&#x2019;re stayin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stubborn fuckers,&#x201d; Bordeaux muttered, crawling off for a better look at the defilade to their north. Three of the enemy had already occupied the depression, and they opened fire the second they saw his face. He jerked the pin from a grenade and slung it in their direction before scrabbling back to the others, taking more hits, one to the arm and another to the boron carbide ballistic panel on his back. The grenade went off with a sharp blast, flinging body parts into the air. Bordeaux and his men all sprang into a crouch, firing in all four directions as the enemy continued to maneuver aggressively against them.<br> <br>One of the Rangers took a round to the face and fell over backward.<br> <br>Knowing they were down to mere seconds now, Bordeaux fired his M4 until the magazine ran dry then jerked his M9 pistol and turned to aim it at Sandra.<br> <br>She winked at him and covered her eyes with her hand.<br> <br>He hesitated a fraction of an instant, remembering the night before, and then squeezed the trigger.<br> <br>A 7.62 mm slug blew out the side of his head, causing the round from his pistol to strike the ground near Sandra&#x2019;s shoulder as he toppled from his knees.<br> <br>Sergeant Tornero spun to fire on the man who&#x2019;d killed Bordeaux, stitching him from the groin to the throat before taking multiple hits to his armor, limbs, and guts. He pitched forward onto his hands and knees, still taking hits, choking blood as he crawled desperately forward to cover Sandra&#x2019;s body with his own.<br> <br>Sandra was struggling to tug Tornero&#x2019;s pistol from its holster when the shadowy figure of a Taliban fighter blocked out the sun. He stepped on her hand and reached down to take the pistol from the holster, tossing it to one of his men before hefting Tornero&#x2019;s body aside. He spoke calmly in Pashto, pointing at the American weapons on the ground, ordering them gathered up. The Rangers were quickly stripped of their armor and ammunition, their boots, money, watches, dog tags&#x2014;everything.<br> <br>Deep in shock, Sandra was vaguely aware of being lifted from the ground and slung over the shoulder of a squat, muscular man. She opened her eyes briefly, seeing the ground passing below, the sandaled heels of her captor moving back and forth as he walked along.<br> <br>They walked all the rest of the day, taking turns carrying their prisoner toward the foothills near the Pakistan border. Sometime after nightfall, Sandra awoke to feel herself jostling around in the back of a pickup truck as it made its way higher into the mountains of the Hindu Kush. She mumbled that she was cold, and someone in the back of the truck with her must have spoken English because she was covered with a coat a few moments later.<br> <br>The next time she awoke was to a bright light being shined into one of her eyes. She was carried from the truck on what felt like a sheet of plywood into a dimly lit hut where she felt needles being pricked into her. She screamed aloud when a steel probe was inserted into her leg wound and struggled against the pain. Someone with gorilla-like strength held her down while the bullet was removed and the wound was sutured closed. After that, a dirty brown sack was slipped over her head, and she was put back into the truck and driven away.<br> <br>Later in the night, the bag was taken off and she was made to drink a great deal more water than she cared to, a bright flashlight being shined into her face the entire time. She coughed and gagged, swallowing as much as she could, and the canteen was finally taken away and the bag replaced. After what felt like an eternity, the truck stopped again, and she was carried into another building where she was tied to some kind of a wooden bed.<br> <br>She awoke in the morning with her leg fevered and throbbing to find that she was still tied to the bed, but that her boots and flight suit had been taken away, replaced with a kind of dirty white gown made from a coarse cloth. A man of about forty sat beside her bed reading the Koran through a pair of dark-framed glasses that seemed too large for his face. He wore the white jubbah of a Muslim cleric, and his neatly trimmed black beard was flecked with gray.<br> <br>He looked up to see her watching him and slowly closed the Koran, setting it aside on a table. &#x201c;You are awake,&#x201d; he said in good English.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to have my uniform back,&#x201d; was the first thing she said.<br> <br>He removed the glasses from his face and folded them away into the pocket of his robe. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s been burned,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Your leg has been repaired, and you are far away from your people now. Very far away. They will not be able to find you here. I am Aasif Kohistani of the Hezb-e Islami Khalis. I am the political leader you and your friends were preparing to illegally kidnap from my village in Nangarhar.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Brux,&#x201d; Sandra said. &#x201c;Sandra J., Warrant Officer. 280-76-0987.&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiled a humorless smile. &#x201c;I have that information already.&#x201d; He took from the table a handful of dog tags taken from Sandra&#x2019;s dead compatriots and selected hers from the collection. &#x201c;You are also Catholic. What else can you tell me about CIA intentions against our party? Are they preparing military strikes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I be untied?&#x201d; Sandra asked, her mouth dry as a sock.<br> <br>He set the dog tags aside. &#x201c;It is impossible that you will not tell me what I want to know,&#x201d; he said patiently. &#x201c;It would be better for you to tell me now. This will prevent great difficulties for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just a pilot,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The CIA doesn&#x2019;t tell us about their plans. I don&#x2019;t even know why they wanted you.&#x201d; And what worried Sandra the most was that this was the truth. She had no idea why the CIA wanted Kohistani or whether or not there were any military strikes being planned.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are not just a pilot,&#x201d; he said, taking her Night Stalker shoulder patch from the table. &#x201c;You are one of these people. We know this name very well. I will give you one last opportunity to tell me what you know. After that I will call Ramesh.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You really have to believe me,&#x201d; she begged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything! If I did, I would tell you. I don&#x2019;t give a shit about the CIA.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is not the answer I was looking for.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want me to make something up?&#x201d; she said helplessly. As she lay there trying to think back to the mock interrogations she had undergone during survival school, Kohistani calmly lifted a previously unnoticed wooden rod from the foot of the bed and gave her a sharp crack against the bullet wound in her thigh.<br> <br>Pain exploded in her leg. She arched her back involuntarily, her entire body going ramrod stiff, barely stifling the cry that threatened to rip from her throat.

This appealing book collects the best of these mail-able, miniature works of art by the likes of Yoko Ono and Carl Andre.</strong></p><p>The accessibility and familiarity of a postcard makes it an artistic medium rich with potential for subversion, appropriation, or manipulation for political, satirical, revolutionary, or playful intent. The inexpensiveness of production encourages artists to experiment with their design; the only artistic restriction: that it fits through the mailbox slot. Unlike traditional works of art, the postcard requires nothing more than a stamp for it to be seen on the other side of the world. Made of commonplace material, postcards invite handling, asking to be picked up, turned over, and shown to friends&#x2015;to be included in our lives.</p><p><em>The World Exists to Be Put on a Postcard</em> features postcards, several reproduced at actual size, designed by notable modern and contemporary artists, including Carl Andre, Eleanor Antin, Joseph Beuys, Tacita Dean, Gilbert &amp; George, Richard Hamilton, Susan Hiller, Richard Long, Bruce Nauman, Yoko Ono, Dieter Roth, Gavin Turk, Mark Wallinger, Rachel Whiteread, and Hannah Wilke, many of which are published here for the first time. Organized thematically into chapters, such as &#x201c;Graphic Postcards,&#x201d; &#x201c;Political Postcards,&#x201d; &#x201c;Portrait Postcards,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Composite Postcards,&#x201d; this book demonstrates the significance of artists&#x2019; postcards in contemporary art.</p> 100 color illustrations</p><p>Jeremy Cooper&nbsp;has written and published widely on art and antiques.

The founding of late-nineteenth-century "chop suey" restaurants that pitched an altered version of Cantonese cuisine to white patrons despite a virulently anti-Chinese climate is one of several pivotal events in Anne Mendelson's thoughtful history of American Chinese food. <i>Chow Chop Suey</i> uses cooking to trace different stages of the Chinese community's footing in the larger white society.<br><br>Mendelson begins with the arrival of men from the poorest district of Canton Province during the Gold Rush. She describes the formation of American Chinatowns and examines the curious racial dynamic underlying the purposeful invention of hybridized Chinese American food, historically prepared by Cantonese-descended cooks for whites incapable of grasping Chinese culinary principles. Mendelson then follows the eventual abolition of anti-Chinese immigration laws and the many demographic changes that transformed the face of Chinese cooking in America during and after the Cold War. Mendelson concludes with the post-1965 arrival of Chinese immigrants from Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and many regions of mainland China. As she shows, they have immeasurably enriched Chinese cooking in America but tend to form comparatively self-sufficient enclaves in which they, unlike their predecessors, are not dependent on cooking for a white clientele.</p><p>Anne Mendelson is a culinary historian and freelance writer specializing in food-related subjects. She has worked as editorial consultant and collaborator on several cookbooks and has contributed entries to the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America</i> (2005). She is the author of <i>Milk</i> (2008) and <i>Stand Facing the Stove </i>(1996).<i>Chow Chop Suey</i> is an eye-opener, a book that will give everyone a deep appreciation of the exquisite skill required to produce authentic Chinese food and the sweep of history that brought Chinese cooking to America. Anne Mendelson's prodigious research has given us a highly respectful, insightful, refreshing, wonderfully written, and utterly compelling account of the role and plight of Chinese restaurant workers in this country. I learned something new on every page. (Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University and author of <i>Soda Politics</i>)<br><br>Well-written and impeccably researched, <i>Chow Chop Suey</i> is a beautiful ode both to the history of Chinese Americans and the intriguing ways in which China's rich food culture continues to take root here and flourish. Anne Mendelson's section on Chinese American cookbook writers is nothing less than a classic, for she brings sense and order to a long overlooked field with her customary clear perspective and dry wit. Mendelson is one of my favorite food writers and I'd expect nothing less, but this time she's outdone herself. (Carolyn Phillips, author of <i>All Under Heaven: Recipes from the 35 Cuisines of China</i> and <i>The Dim Sum Field Guide</i>)<br><br>There are other accounts of the American enthusiasm for Chinese food and the simultaneous persecution of Chinese immigrants. What makes Anne Mendelson's <i>Chow Chop Suey</i> unique is how it integrates cooking styles with American and Chinese cultural contrasts. Mendelson never loses sight of the food and how Chinese restaurants and American "experts" of various sorts shaped a cuisine that was both exotic and irresistible. No one has discussed in such a fascinating and authoritative way the American misunderstanding of basic Chinese culinary principles, the importance of a few key cookbooks and restaurants, and the gradual awakening of American palates to something resembling actual Chinese food in the postwar decades. Fun to read, judicious, and above all authoritative. (Paul Freedman, author of<i> Out of the East: Spices and the Medieval Imagination</i>)<br><br><i>Chow Chop Suey</i> is a well-written and insightful guide to the Chinese food scene in America. In a field full of myths, Anne Mendelson's book is accurate and detailed. A delightful read! (Eugene N. Anderson, author of, <i>Food and Environment in Early and Medieval China</i>)<br><br>Anne Mendelson brings together political and culinary history, showing that it was by inventing quasi-Chinese dishes that titillated American palates that Cantonese immigrants found a way to survive anti-Asia persecution. Gripping, authoritative, and timely. (Rachel Laudan, author of <i>Cuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History</i>)<br><br>A deeply researched look at the history of Chinese food in the U.S. I'll be dipping into it for years. (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>A timely and nuanced reminder that Chinese-American identity has long been conflated with Chinese food. (Peter Ho Davies <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>Anne Mendelson writes like the engaged scholar she is, with dry wit and easy, uncompromising erudition.... [Chow Chop Suey] is full of wonder. (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>A solid choice for readers interested in Chinese immigration and U.S.-China history, as well as those curious about American foodways and culinary culture. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><i>Chow Chop Suey</i> provides a nuanced and invaluable analysis of America&#x2019;s struggle to codify Chinese and Chinese American cooking in English . . . Mendelson maintains a compelling narrative that successfully enlivens a story close-to-overflowing with detail.

By nature clever and spirited, she struggles to submit to the iron rule of the Matron and Sisters, and is alternately infuriated and charmed by her patients. That&#39;s not to mention the mountains of menial work that are a trainee&#39;s lot. But there are friends among the staff and patients, night-time escapades to dances with dashing army men, and her secret writing project to keep her going.</p><p>Monica Dickens (1915-92) was born into a well-to-do London family and was the great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens. Chafing against her background and having been expelled from St Paul's Girls School, she trained as a domestic servant and her experiences inspired her first memoir,<i>One Pair of Hands</i>(1939). She then turned to nursing, and produced<i>One Pair of Feet</i>(1942). She wrote numerous novels and memoirs, and found huge popular recognition as creator of the TV and children's books series<i>Follyfoot</i>. In the 1950s she moved to the US, and remained there for much of her life, writing and doing humanitarian work - she founded the US branch of the Samaritans - before returning to the UK in 1985.Cheerful impudence ... And occasional touches of pathos. -- JB Priestley A brilliantly funny account. -- Elizabeth Bowen One Pair of Feet is not just a spirited and entertaining account of the training of a hospital nurse in wartime but a fascinating glimpse into a time and a culture so recent and yet so utterly changed. * Marina Lewycka *</p><h2>The Second Church: Popular Christianity A.D. 200-400 (Writings from the Greco-Roman World Supplement)</h2><p>Christianity in the century both before and after Constantine s conversion is familiar thanks to the written sources; now Ramsay MacMullen, in his fifth book on ancient Christianity, considers especially the unwritten evidence. He uses excavation reports about hundreds of churches of the fourth century to show what worshipers did in them and in the cemeteries where most of them were built. What emerges, in this richly illustrated work, is a religion that ordinary Christians, by far the majority, practiced in a different and largely forgotten second church. The picture fits with textual evidence that has been often misunderstood or little noticed. The first church the familiar one governed by bishops in part condemned, in part tolerated, and in part re-shaped the church of the many. Even together, however, the two constituted by the end of the period studied (AD 400) a total of the population far smaller than has ever been suggested. Better estimates are now made for the first time from quantifiable data, that is, from the physical space available for attendance in places of worship. Reassessment raises very large questions about the place of religion in the life of the times and in the social composition of both churches.</p><p>Ramsay MacMullen is Dunham Professor Emeritus of History and Classics at Yale University. He is the recipient of a lifetime Award for Scholarly Distinction from the American Historical Association and the author of numerous volumes on Christianity and the Roman Empire.</p><h2>Great Swan: Meetings with Ramakrishna</h2><p>Dramatically recreates a series of delightful encounters with a great spiritual teacher.</p><p>Lex Hixon holds joint citizenship in several sacred worlds - Advaita Vedanta, Islamic Sufism, Vajrayana Buddhis, Easter Orthodox Christianity, and Soto Zen. He received a doctorate in philosophy and religion from Columbia University and is the author of Coming Home: The Experience of Enlightenment in Sacred Traditions and Heart of the Koran.A remarkable portrait of a most remarkable spiritual teacher. Though little known in the West, Ramakrishna (1836-86) is generally revered in India as a direct incarnation of God, similar in some ways to Christ. Rather than write a standard biography of this Hindu mystic who embraced and, reportedly, embodied the essence of all major world religions--a biography like Richard Schiffman's Sri Ramakrishna (1989)--Hixon (Coming Home, 1978) here attempts a more daunting task: to re-create the experience of observing, over the course of years, a man who ``has attained the goal of spiritual evolution.'' To do this, the author draws on numerous eyewitness accounts of the sage, smoothly blending them into the voice of a disciple who observes his ``Master'' lecturing, conversing, playing, singing, dancing, and slipping into profound mystical ecstasies. There is no skepticism in this devotional telling but, rather, a pervasive sense of wonder and even rapture that Hixon makes concrete through tight physical detail, as in this deathbed scene: ``Ramakrishna's charming smile and the fresh white cloth around his waist shine in the flickering lamplight. His honey-colored skin, dulled by illness, seems to regain its extraordinary luster....The room is being filled with light....It is like a lightning flash, prolonged for several minutes. The pressure is unbearable....'' There is also much inspired exposition by Ramakrishna of religious principles and practices, making this account of great interest to those spiritually inclined but occasionally a tough go for those more interested in Ramakrishna's incandescent character than in his teachings. You don't have to share Hixon's conviction in order to appreciate his achievement in evoking--artfully and with considerable emotional power--what it might be like to encounter, as Ramakrishna put it, ``a human emanation of Divine Reality.'' -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is all just what I have seen and heard. And if, when making ready to take leave of life, I consider allowing the publication of my hurried notes, it is not because I expect posthumous revaluation or vindication, but because I believe that honest testimonial of the truth in this sad world may still be useful in bringing relief to the innocent and striking at those who are responsible.' <br><br>Count Galeazzo Ciano was foreign minister in Fascist Italy from 1936 until 1943. He was also Mussolini's son-in-law. This fascinating diary gives a day to day account of this passage through the war, his meetings with the Duce and other key figures of the conflict including Hitler and Von Ribbentrop. It becomes, in effect, a history of Italy under Mussolini. But the story does not end happily. In 1943, as the Italian war effort began to crumble in the wake of an allied invasion from the South, Ciano was dismissed as Foreign Minister after his involvement in a plot to depose Mussolini. Under pressure from the Nazis, Ciano was executed by firing squad in Verona in January 1944. His diaries provide a unique and perceptive insight into this remarkable period of history, revealing a man that, unlike many of his colleagues, did not embrace war.</p><p></p><h2>The Athenian Agora: Site Guide (5th ed.)</h2><p>This definitive guide to the archaeological remains in the civic and commercial center of ancient Athens is an essential companion to the interested visitor, as well as to students of the topography of the classical city.

Irwin <i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i>)</p><h2>Dear Ijeawele or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions</h2><p><b>An instant feminist classic, and perfect gift for all parents, women, and people working towards gender equality. Here is a brilliant, beautifully readable, and above all practical expansion of the ideas this iconic author began to explore in her bestselling manifesto, <i>We Should All Be Feminists</i>.</b><br><br>A few years ago, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie received a letter from a dear friend from childhood, asking how to raise her new baby girl a feminist.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she has written and spoken out widely about feminism, Adichie wasn't sure how to advise her friend Ijeawele. But as a person who'd babysat, had loved her nieces and nephews, and now, too, was the mother of a daughter herself, she thought she would try. So she sent Ijeawele a letter with some suggestions--15 in all--which she has now decided to share with the world. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compelling, direct, wryly funny, and perceptive, <i>Dear Ijeawele </i>offers specifics on how we can empower our daughters to become strong, independent women. Here, too, are ways parents can raise their children--both sons and daughters--beyond a culture's limiting gender prescriptions. This short, sharp work rings out in Chimamanda's voice: infused with deep honesty, clarity, strength, and above all love. She speaks to the important work of raising a girl in today's world, and provides her readers with a clear proposal for inclusive, nuanced thinking. Here we have not only a rousing manifesto, but a powerful gift for all people invested in the idea of creating a just society--an endeavour now more urgent and important than ever.</p><p>CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE grew up in Nigeria. Her work has been translated into thirty languages and has appeared in various publications, including <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Granta</i>, <i>The O. Henry Prize Stories</i>, the<i> Financial Times</i>, and <i>Zoetrope: All-Story</i>. She is the author of the novels <i>Purple Hibiscus</i>, which won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize and the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award;<i> Half of a Yellow Sun</i>, which won the Orange Prize and was a National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist, a <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book, and a People and Black Issues Book Review Best Book of the Year; <i>Americanah</i>, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was a <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>Entertainment Weekly </i>Best Book of the Year; and the story collection <i>The Thing Around Your Neck</i>. A recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, she divides her time between the United States and Nigeria.When a couple of years ago a friend of mine from childhood, who&#x2019;d grown into a brilliant, strong, kind woman, asked me to tell her how to raise her baby girl a feminist, my first thought was that I did not know. <br><br>It felt like too huge a task. <br><br>But I had spoken publicly about feminism and perhaps that made her feel I was an expert on the subject. I had over the years also helped care for many babies of loved ones; I had worked as a babysitter and helped raise my nephews and nieces. I had done a lot of watching and listening, and I had done even more thinking.<br><br>In response to my friend&#x2019;s request, I decided to write her a letter, which I hoped would be honest and practical, while also serving as a map of sorts for my own feminist thinking. This book is a version of that letter, with some details changed. <br><br>Now that I, too, am the mother of a delightful baby girl, I realize how easy it is to dispense advice about raising a child when you are not facing the enormously complex reality of it yourself. Still, I think it is morally urgent to have honest conversations about raising children differently, about trying to create a fairer world for women and men. <br><br>My friend sent me a reply saying she would &#x201c;try&#x201d; to follow my suggestions. <br><br>And in rereading these as a mother, I, too, am determined to try.</p><h2>The Matthew Effect: How Advantage Begets Further Advantage</h2><p>The old saying does often seem to hold true: the rich get richer while the poor get poorer, creating a widening gap between those who have more and those who have less. The sociologist Robert K. Merton called this phenomenon the Matthew effect, named after a passage in the gospel of Matthew. Yet the more closely we examine the sociological effects of this principle, the more complicated the idea becomes. Initial advantage doesn't always lead to further advantage, and disadvantage doesn't necessarily translate into failure. Does this theory need to be revisited?<br><br>Merton's arguments have significant implications for our conceptions of equality and justice, and they challenge our beliefs about culture, education, and public policy. His hypothesis has been examined across a variety of social arenas, including science, technology, politics, and schooling, to see if, in fact, advantage begets further advantage. Daniel Rigney is the first to evaluate Merton's theory of cumulative advantage extensively, considering both the conditions that uphold the Matthew effect and the circumstances that cause it to fail. He explores whether growing inequality is beyond human control or disparity is socially constructed and subject to change. Reexamining our core assumptions about society, Rigney causes us to rethink the sources of inequity.</p><p>Daniel Rigney, a sociologist at St. Mary's University in San Antonio, was director of the university's honors program for twenty-three years. With an interest in social theory, the sociology of religion and culture, and social justice issues, he is the author of <i>The Metaphorical Society: An Invitation to Social Theory</i> and is married to the historian Alida Metcalf.In the Gospel according to Matthew, Jesus says, To anyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; from anyone who has not, even what he has will be taken away. Based on this enigmatic statement, the sociologist Robert K. Merton labeled the tendency of the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer the Matthew effect. St. Mary's University sociology professor Rigney (<i>The Metaphorical Society</i>) presents evidence from science, technology, the economy, politics, public policy, education, and culture to show that, generally speaking, this dynamic is so strong that it might be considered a social law: initial advantages position one for further advantages. The writing is terse, cataloguing study after study in a few paragraphs to establish the tendency of inequality to grow with the passage of time. A concluding chapter examines the ethical and policy implications of Matthew effects&#x2014;for example, should socially disadvantaged students be given more aid than the advantaged? Rigney's summary of the latest research findings should contribute to a much needed discussion between policy makers, social scientists, and the general public. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It first offers a step-by-step look at the entire diagnostic process, up to and including the diagnosis, and suggests how you should go about getting a second and even a third opinion. It then describes twelve different treatment choices that may be considered. Other important topics include genetic testing, Carbon-11 Acetate PET/CT scans for earlier identification of metastases, medication therapy, and more. Studies have proven that most men diagnosed with prostate cancer do not need surgery or radiation treatment. <strong><i>Prostate Cancer Breakthroughs</i></strong> tells you how to determine what your options are. In the words of one reviewer, "This book answers all of your questions and others you didn't know to ask."<br><br>In this book, you will discover: <br> * Why 85% of men who get surgery or radiation for prostate cancer do not need it. <br> * Why a high PSA test does not necessarily mean cancer. <br> * How to tell if you really need a biopsy (many men don't). <br> * Why a targeted biopsy is superior to a standard biopsy, and where to get one. <br> * Why dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE-MRI) is key to deciding on treatment. <br> * Which genetic tests are available for accurate diagnosis and more effective therapy.<br>* If medication, rather than surgery/radiation, is a valid choice for you.<br><br>Today, many doctors and patients are still not aware of the breakthrough methods of diagnosis and treatment that are being used at top United States cancer centers. <strong><i>Prostate Cancer Breakthroughs</i></strong> provides the up-to-date information you need to make the choices that are right for you.</p></p><p><p><i>Jay S.

In each period, the dominant ideology was so strong that it united even partisan opponents. But the neoliberal era is collapsing, and the central question of our time is what comes next. <br>As acclaimed legal scholar and policy expert Ganesh Sitaraman argues, two political visions now contend for the future. One is nationalist oligarchy, which rigs the system for the rich and powerful while using nationalism to mobilize support. The other is the great democracy, which fights corruption and extends both political and economic power to all people.

Led by Mao Tse Tung, they set off on a strategic retreat to the barren north of China, thousands of miles away. As Sun Shuyun travels along the march route, her interviews with survivors and villagers show that the forces at work during the days of the revolution &#x2013; poverty, sickness, and Mao's use of terror, propaganda, and ruthless purges &#x2013; have shaped modern China irrevocably.

It was mid&#x2013;October, 1935, in Jiangxi Province, southern China. The autumn harvest was already in and the land surrounding the village was yellow with the stubble of rice stalks, but some fields stood as if wasted, with grass sprouting in the dried&#x2013;out paddy, already turning brown. A few water buffalo were plodding home, only stopping when they came to their favorite place, the village pond, where they drank, ducks and geese swam, children bathed, women washed their clothes, and men asked one another about their day. Nearby stood the giant camphor tree, whose overhanging branches gave ample shelter from the rain and intense heat of the South.<br><br>Today the water buffalo had the pond to themselves, and only the village ancestor shrine opposite showed signs of life, but not with pious prayers and hypnotic chants offered to the ancestors: only the revolutionary song calling on young men to join the Red Army. Through the imposing entrance topped by grey&#x2013;tiled eaves, boys carrying spears rushed in and out, looking solemn, as if they had been entrusted with the most important task of their lives. Two young women were putting a table and some benches outside the gate. As the song died away, more women came out, clutching shoes they were making out of cloth, calling their children, while others gathered up firewood from outside the gate, and went home to cook.<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody is too tired to sing! Keep up the good work!&#x201d; called Wang Quanyuan, the young woman who had just emerged from a house nearby. She had on a grey cotton jacket, the kind every soldier wore, tied with a rope round her waist, but its simplicity made her beauty stand out even more. She asked one woman to bring more benches, and then stopped one of the boys who was running by, and whispered something in his ear; nodding eagerly, he took to his heels.<br><br>Wang noticed the slogans on the white wall of the shrine, written in black ink but slightly washed out by the summer rain. &#x201c;Down with the Landlords and Evil Gentry!&#x201d; &#x201c;Long Live the Communists!&#x201d; &#x201c;Long Live the Soviet!&#x201d; &#x201c;I mustn&#x2019;t forget to tell them to repaint the slogans,&#x201d; she murmured to herself, remembering that until four years ago she had no idea what Soviet was. Someone had told her that it was a foreign shop, and others said he was the brother of a famous Communist labor organizer. A warlord definitely thought so: he had posted a notice throughout the villages, offering a reward for the capture, dead or alive, of Mr. Soviet. In the local dialect, Soviet was pronounced Su&#x2013;wei&#x2013;ai, which meant &#x201c;we,&#x201d; so perhaps the Soviet was our government, she once thought. Now she was actually working for the youth and women's departments of the Soviet, a government of workers and peasants that had been set up by Mao and his Red Army in southern Jiangxi in 1931. Small as it was, with barely three million people in half a dozen counties, hemmed in on all sides by Chiang Kaishek's Nationalist troops, the Jiangxi Soviet had all the functions of a state. Wang was told that the Communist Party was working to turn the whole of China into a Soviet. That would be the day, Wang smiled, but then became very solemn. &#x201c;Everything hangs on tonight,&#x201d; she muttered to herself.<br><br>As darkness fell, the bell hanging from the camphor tree rang out. Four giant bamboo torches lit up the pond and the gate of the shrine hall. Women, and a few men, old and young, gathered with several hundred people from nearby villages, summoned by Wang&#x2019;s Red Pioneers. She had also sent for half a dozen militiamen from the county Party headquarters; when they finally arrived, Wang stood up and delivered her speech:<br><br>&#x201c;Sisters and brothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, the Red Army is at its most critical time now, with many wounded every day. But in a war, there is always winning and losing. If we stop fighting just because we have lost a few battles, our Revolution will never succeed and we will always be exploited by the rich. You are strong. Do you want to be trampled on for the rest of your lives? If not, join the Red Army now!&#x201d;<br><br>There was no reply.<br><br>Wang nodded to the militiamen who were standing close by, and continued: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be afraid. We will win. Use your brain. This village has hundreds of poor people, and only one or two landlords. Aren&#x2019;t we more powerful than them? All we need to do is to unite, but there is a traitor who does not want this to happen. He seems to care about you, telling you to keep your men at home, but if we all stay at home, our enemy will come, taking our land and raping our women. Is that what you want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not!&#x201d; shouted the militiamen.<br><br>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s bring the traitor out.&#x201d; Wang waved her hand. Two militiamen appeared from behind the shrine gate, each holding the arm of a man, followed by a third with a pistol in his hand. Silence fell and the villagers looked at each other speechless. The accused was none other than the Party secretary of their district, Mr. Liu. Suddenly, a Red Pioneer raised his arm, shouting, &#x201c;Down with the traitor! Kill the traitor!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me, what do you want done with him?&#x201d; Wang asked several times.<br><br>&#x201c;Kill him,&#x201d; yelled a militiaman.<br><br>&#x201c;Kill him now!&#x201d; a chorus of voices followed.<br><br>Two shots at point&#x2013;blank range and Liu fell to the ground. Wang announced grimly: &#x201c;This will be the fate of anyone who dares to sabotage the Revolution.&#x201d;<br><br>It was hard to believe, when I met Woman Wang, that she had ever done such things, or suffered more than I could bear to think about. She had started as the quintessential supporter of the Revolution. Poverty had made her family sell her into a marriage which she did not want; joining the Communists represented hope. Chosen as one of only 30 women to go with the 1st Army among 86,000 men, she survived and rose to head the Red Army&#x2019;s only women&#x2019;s regiment. A year later, she was captured, raped, and given to a Nationalist officer as a concubine&#x2014;a &#x201c;crime&#x201d; for which she was denounced by the Party, remaining under a cloud for the next fifty years. Still, she remained loyal to the Party, which she regarded as dearer to her than her parents. I remember thinking to myself after reading her biography: if there was ever a true Communist faithful, it must be Wang.<br><br>What better way to start my journey than by talking to her? I set out in October 2004, exactly seventy years after the Chinese Communist Party and the 1st Army abandoned their base in Jiangxi and began their escape from the Nationalists&#x2014;the Long March as it became known. From Beijing I took the train, eighteen hours due south, and then after two hours more by bus through green-clad mountains and hills I found myself in Taihe in southern Jiangxi. It was a big town, with a grand new avenue, beautifully surfaced and complete with modern lighting&#x2014;not many buildings yet, but looking for twenty&#x2013;first&#x2013;century growth. I wondered if I would have trouble finding Wang&#x2014;after all, Taihe had a population of half a million people and all I had was her biography, which I had been rereading on the train. I took a rickshaw from the long&#x2013;distance bus stop and mentioned Wang&#x2019;s name hesitantly; I was relieved when the driver told me to take it easy. &#x201c;What a woman! How many went on the Long March from Jiangxi? Eighty thousand? I guess not many of them are left today. Three in this town, and forty in Jiangxi. If you come next year, they will probably all be gone.&#x201d; He took me down the big avenue and then into the old quarter. Dusty, narrow, busy, and crowded, just like the photographs of provincial towns in the 1930s. I was dropped off next to a dumpling shop with a queue of hungry customers. Behind it was Wang's courtyard, shaded by a pomegranate tree with its dark red fruit just bursting open. Beneath it, there she sat, looking gentle, serene, and elegant, belying her 91 years, and without a trace of the toughness of the Red Army commander.<br><br>She was not surprised to see me, a complete stranger, walking in off the street and wanting to find out about her past. My copy of her biography was a good enough introduction. She asked me to sit down and called, &#x201c;Another visitor from Beijing!&#x201d; A middle&#x2013;aged woman came out. From what I had read, I assumed she was her adopted daughter&#x2014;Wang was unable to conceive after the Long March. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t ask too many questions, she gets too excited. Last week we had a journalist from Beijing, and she talked so much, it made her ill. Anyway, it is all in there,&#x201d; she said, referring to the book on my lap. Wang cut her short. &#x201c;They think talking is a waste of breath, but they don&#x2019;t understand. So many men and women died for the good life we live today and I want people to remember that.&#x201d; She sent her daughter back inside for another biography, written by a local Party historian. &#x201c;You might not have come across it.&#x201d;<br><br>The daughter came out with the book and a tray of sliced watermelon. &#x201c;Eat now, read later. I will answer all your questions. It will take you a few days&#x2014;you see, unfortunately, I have had such a long life.&#x201d; She took a mouthful of the melon, and smiled, as if it was the rarest fruit in the world and she was tasting it for the first time. Clearly she was keen to talk. She was quick and warm, and over the next three days she opened up like the pomegranates&#x2014;I heard of the idealism, the hope, the suffering, the sacrifice, the harshness, and the courage of her life, like those of so many others. But Wang also painted in some of the shadows of her history, things that were almost against her nature to reveal, and most certainly at odds with the glorious stories of the Long March that I had grown up with.<br><br>Wang was born in 1913 in Lufu Village, not far from where she lives now. Her family barely had enough rice for six months after the landlord took his exorbitant rent. From the age of 5, she roamed the mountains with her sister to collect wild plants to eat. By the time she was 11, her parents found her a husband, who offered to pay off the family debt of 200 kilos of rice. She was in the dark about the arrangement until the wedding day, when her mother dressed her in a bright red outfit, and put her on a palanquin sent by the groom. He was sixteen years older than Wang, slightly retarded, and with so many smallpox scars he was nicknamed Big Smallpox. The villagers said a flower had been planted on a cowpie. When Wang saw him, she fainted, but her mother said the rice was in the pot, and nothing could be done about it.<br><br>Her parents&#x2019; only request was that he would not consummate the marriage until Wang was 18. Meanwhile, she would work like a slave in his household. But he could not wait for seven years: he slept around and the wife of a blind fortune&#x2013;teller bore him a son. Gossip spread around the village and Wang was so humiliated that she returned to her parents&#x2019; house, hoping they would pity her and annul the marriage. No, you must go back, her mother told her. &#x201c;When you marry a chicken, live with a chicken; when you marry a dog, live with a dog.&#x201d; It was fate.<br><br>When the Red Army marched into her village in the spring of 1930, she learned it was not fate. &#x201c;Why do the landlords have so much land, while you have none?&#x201d; a Red Army officer asked her and her family. &#x201c;Why do they eat fat pork every day, while you don&#x2019;t see one drop of oil for a whole year? Why do they wear silk while you are in rags? It isn&#x2019;t fair! For every one of them, there are ten of us. If we unite, we are bound to win. What do you say? Join us! Join the Revolution!&#x201d; She signed up on the spot, and her family received land, salt, rice, ham, and tools, all confiscated from the landlords.<br><br>She told everyone about the benefits of the Communist Revolution, citing herself and her family as examples. And she did so by using the most popular method in rural Jiangxi&#x2014;folk songs. She set new words to the old tunes, not the usual love ballads but full of zeal for the Revolution. She was so good, she was given the nickname &#x201c;Golden Throat.&#x201d; This was one of her favorites:<br><i>If we save the mountain, we&#x2019;ll have wood.<br>If we save the river, we&#x2019;ll have fish to fry.<br>If we save the Revolution, we&#x2019;ll have our own land.<br>If we save the Soviet, red flags will fly.</i><br>In December 1933, Wang had some unexpected news. Her devotion and success in work with women and young people brought her to Ruijin, the Red capital, as the people&#x2019;s representative for the Second National Congress of the Soviet.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you visited Ruijin?&#x201d; Wang asked me expectantly. I said I was going to after seeing her.<br><br>&#x201c;You should have gone there first. It was the capital! An old lady like me can wait. You know, we had a saying at the time: up north it is Beijing; down south it is Ruijin.&#x201d;<br><br>She did concede later, although very reluctantly, that Ruijin could not compare with Beijing. It was a typical southern town with good <i>feng shui</i>. The curving Mian River embraced it, and an undulating mountain range shielded it from the west, with a white pagoda overlooking it from the hill to the east. No bigger than an average county town, its four gates and four roads leading in from them crossed at the center, and 7,000 people lived within its walls. Because Chiang had imposed an economic blockade with his Fifth Campaign, many shops had their shutters down. Local products such as bamboo, paper, nuts, and dried vegetables from the mountains could not be shipped out; salt, oil, gasoline, cloth, and other daily necessities could not come in. Those who broke the embargo were liable to punishment or even execution. The Nationalists reinforced the blockade with a Special Movement Corps, whose members had every incentive to catch the offenders&#x2014;they were rewarded with 50 percent of whatever they confiscated.<br><br>Wherever there were profits, there were smugglers: salt, medicine, gunpowder, and other much-needed items were transported, hidden in coffins, at the bottom of manure baskets, and inside bamboo poles. They even managed to bring in an X&#x2013;ray machine in a coffin, with three dozen men and women pretending to be grieving relatives, crying their eyes out. The warlord of Guangdong also defied the blockade by secretly buying tungsten that was found in abundance within the Soviet. But it was like throwing a cup of water onto flaming firewood. Ruijin was feeling the pinch. Salt was the scarcest commodity; Wang did not taste salt for months, and out of sheer desperation she and her friends scraped the white deposits from the walls of toilets, and even from graveyards, and boiled them down.</p><h2>Crochet Mandala: 12 Most Gorgeous Patterns With Easy Instructions: (Crochet Hook A, Crochet Accessories, Crochet Patterns, Crochet Books, Easy Crochet ...

How does it relate to works and the Law? And what difference that make in my life or yours? You will find the answers to those questions and more in this commentary on Galatians and Ephesians by Mal Couch and the late John Witmer.</p> <p>GALATIANS is a book all about God and His gospel. There were those who the Galatians that keeping the Law would make them righteous. There still those today who say that the work of Christ is insufficient, that we must add something to His sacrifice-our own merits or the merits of others. The reader will discover afresh that salvation is by Christ alone, through grace along, and by faith alone.</p> <p>EPHESIANS is a book about the church and believers. It echoes the teaching of Galatians in stating, "For by grace have you been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast." But Ephesians lays on this foundation an understanding of the purpose of the church and the responsibility of the believer. Believers are to live in unity and imitate God by good works. the reader will learn what difference the gospel makes in our daily lives.</p> <p>In <i>Galatians</i> &amp;<i> Ephesians</i> the reader will discern both the heart of the apostle Paul and the heart of the New Testament gospel.

Like most early American colleges, Rutgers depended on slaves to build its campuses and serve its students and faculty; it depended on the sale of black people to fund its very existence. Men like John Henry Livingston, (Rutgers president from 1810&#x2013;1824), the Reverend Philip Milledoler, (president of Rutgers from 1824&#x2013;1840), Henry Rutgers, (trustee after whom the college is named), and Theodore Frelinghuysen, (Rutgers&#x2019;s seventh president), were among the most ardent anti-abolitionists in the mid-Atlantic.<br><br> Scarlet and black are the colors Rutgers University uses to represent itself to the nation and world. They are the colors the athletes compete in, the graduates and administrators wear on celebratory occasions, and the colors that distinguish Rutgers from every other university in the United States. This book, however, uses these colors to signify something else: the blood that was spilled on the banks of the Raritan River by those dispossessed of their land and the bodies that labored unpaid and in bondage so that Rutgers could be built and sustained. The contributors to this volume offer this history as a usable one&#x2014;not to tear down or weaken this very renowned, robust, and growing institution&#x2014;but to strengthen it and help direct its course for the future.<br><br> The work of the Committee on Enslaved and Disenfranchised Population in Rutgers History.<p>Visit the project's website at http://scarletandblack.rutgers.edu<br><br> &nbsp;</p></p><p>MARISA J.

Female Slaves in the Plantation South</i>.<br><br> &nbsp;FOREWORD<br><br> The first stitch of this incredible project, <i>Scarlet and Black</i>, was sewn on May<br> 11, 2015. On that day, in my office in Rutgers University's iconic Old Queen's<br> Building, I met with a small group of students to discuss the current state of<br> race relations at Rutgers. In the course of our conversation, the students made<br> themselves clear: improving the current racial and cultural climate at Rutgers<br> was impossible without answering questions about the university's early history.<br> After a decade at Rutgers as a dean, and then administrator, I felt that I<br> was quite familiar with the oft-told narrative of our beginning days: the Dutch<br> Reformed Church, the royal charter (1766), the first name (Queen's College), the<br> benefactor (Colonel Henry Rutgers), the second name (Rutgers College), and the<br> land grant designation from the Morrill Act (1862), which launched the institution's<br> research ambitions.<br><br> That accepted record was incomplete, the students said. They pointed to<br> Craig Steven Wilder's 2013 book<i>, Ebony and Ivy: Race, Slavery, and the Troubled<br> History of America's Universities</i> as having clues to a deeper, more painful narrative<br> that had yet to be told. Wilder, a professor of American history at the<br> Massachusetts Institute of Technology, made reference in his book to many<br> of our prominent founding families and their involvement in enslavement-<br> Livingston, Hardenbergh, and Rutgers himself.<br><br> The subsequent exploration of the missing narrative of slavery and dispossession,<br> requested by the students and undertaken by the university, must<br> be put in context. Mere months after that meeting in May, many campuses<br> throughout the country were heaved into turmoil as encounters between students<br> and administrators gave rise to renewed activism and questions around<br> what a university's responsibilities are in providing to its students an inclusive<br> and supportive academic environment. Intersecting with these conversations<br> was the university's planned year-long celebration of its 250th anniversary.<br> Running from November 10, 2015 to November 10, 2016, the commemoration<br> sought to pay tribute to an institution whose impact on our country over a quarter<br> of a millennium could be rivaled only by a venerable few. A true telling of our<br> early history was never more due-and never more necessary.<br><br> From these converging factors, we have <i>Scarlet and Black: Slavery and Dispossession</i><br> in Rutgers History. The book is the result of the work of the Committee on<br> Enslaved and Disenfranchised Populations in Rutgers History, which I formed<br> in the fall of 2015. I asked the committee, chaired by Board of Governors Distinguished<br> Professor of History Deborah Gray White, to seek out the untold history<br> that we have ignored for too long, such as that our campus is built on land taken<br> from the Lenni Lenape and that a number of our founders and early benefactors<br> were slaveholders. Given our history as a colonial college, these facts are not<br> unique to Rutgers, but I believed it was time that we began to recognize the role<br> that disadvantaged populations such as African Americans and Native tribes<br> played in the university's development.<br><br> Rutgers is not the first institution to wrestle with such issues. Brown University,<br> for instance, founded just two years before Rutgers, formed a committee<br> charged by its then-president, Ruth Simmons, to "examine the University's<br> historical entanglement with slavery and the slave trade and report our findings<br> openly and truthfully." The Brown committee's report was extensive and honest,<br> and I asked our committee, which was to be composed of students, faculty, and<br> staff, for the same vigorous pursuit of the truth.<br><br> Many of the truths reported within these pages by a dedicated team of<br> researchers are complicated and uncomfortable. Take the example of Theodore<br> Frelinghuysen, scion of one of the most influential and revered families of his<br> day and ours. Frelinghuysen, whose forbears were early supporters of Rutgers's<br> founding, was a notable national figure in public life during the early and middle<br> part of the nineteenth century and served for twelve years (1850-1862) as<br> Rutgers's seventh president. Before his time at Rutgers, he rose to prominence<br> first as New Jersey attorney general, then as a United States senator (1829-1835).<br> It was as a senator that he gained notoriety as a fierce opponent of the removal<br> of Native Americans from their lands. His six-hour speech against the Indian<br> Removal Act of 1830 was not enough to halt its passing, but the "Christian Statesman,"<br> as he was known, told his colleagues that "the Indians are men, endowed<br> with kindred faculties and powers with ourselves"; he demanded to know "in<br> what code of the law of nations, or by what process of abstract deduction, their<br> rights have been extinguished?" Frelinghuysen was also an ardent opponent of<br> slavery, calling the abhorrent institution a "moral evil." Though his opposition<br> to slavery is well documented, Frelinghuysen supported a gradual end to its<br> practice and was a proponent and leader of the American Colonization Society,<br> which sought to remove blacks from America and "repatriate" them to Africa.<br><br> This example and many others in this book raise complex questions for the<br> university to consider as we begin our introspection and reconciliation with<br> the past. During this celebratory year, I have repeatedly said that to truly praise<br> Rutgers, we must honestly know it; and to do that, we must gain a fuller understanding<br> of it. With this book, the first volume of Scarlet and Black, we have<br> begun to do that. It covers the early decades of Rutgers history; in the works are<br> other volumes that will carry the story up to the present.<br><br> While reviewing the manuscript for this book, I couldn't help but recall<br> that conversation with our students in May 2015. I kept thinking about them<br> and about our committee's discovery that an enslaved man named Will helped<br> lay the foundation of Old Queen's, our original and distinctive building-the<br> building that houses my office and where we held that very first discussion.<br> After reading the chapter in this book entitled "His Name Was Will," I thought<br> again of the students and of our conversation and I remarked to myself: "if only<br> they knew." Now they do.<br><br><i>Richard L. Edwards<br> Chancellor, Rutgers University-New Brunswick</i></p><h2>The Story of My Tits</h2><p>"Truly moving.

This lovingly-edited anthology includes stories of childhood at the beach, travel to the Shore, summer beach parties, summer jobs, fishing, sailing, surfing, nightlife, storms, and beachcombing. There are accounts of the whale blown up on the beach, shark attacks, a sea serpent and an aquaplane; natural history including terrapins, horseshoe crabs, and preservation. More textured and reflective than simple accounts of life and fun at the beach, the stories were chosen from several thousand published over five decades in the weekly Beachcomber.</p><p>Margaret Thomas Buchholz is co-author of <i>Great Storms of the Jersey Shore; New Jersey Shipwrecks: 350 Years in the Graveyard of the Atlantic;</i> and editor of <i>Shore Chronicles: Diaries and Travelers Tales from the Jersey Shore 1764-1955,</i> among other titles. Her essays about the Shore have also been included in anthologies and collections. Buchholz was publisher of the Long Beach Island newspaper <i>The Beachcomber</i> from 1955 to 1987 and it is from this perspective that she selected ''the best of'' for this compelling collection. She currently lives year-round in her childhood home in Harvey Cedars, New Jersey, on Barnegat Bay, where her family has been coming since 1833.&#39;&#39;This book gets real -- the real Long Beach Island as its people immersed their lives in it. The stories are invigorating and more fascinating than fiction. Some legendary histories, other essays in the book cover nature to nightlife, and literary stories that capture the essence of this Jersey Shore resort island. This is a collection of 60 of its best stories.&#39;&#39; --The SandPaper (Long Beach Island, NJ)</p><h2>Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (Thorndike Press Large Print Lifestyles)</h2><p>The notable host of StarTalk reveals just what people need to be fluent and ready for the next cosmic headlines: from the Big Bang to black holes, from quarks to quantum mechanics, and from the search for planets to the search for life in the universe.

It was the quality that had once made her a world-class equestrian. And it was the reason she&#x2019;d been elected to introduce herself to Briarwood&#x2019;s intimidatingly gorgeous new resident. It took one week to make Nick Leone the focus of the Virginia town&#x2019;s rumor mill. So far he was a CIA agent, a male model, a fugitive&#x2014;maybe all three. <br><br>Whatever Nick was, Katie learned one thing right away: she liked him. And that made him the greatest danger she&#x2019;d faced since the accident that had ended her riding career. In the five years since, she&#x2019;d buried herself in her business of restoring historic homes, afraid to share her scars with any man&#x2014;scars that had destroyed more than one dream. Nick had disappointments of his own, but after meeting Katie, he sensed that fate had a better plan all along. And soon he would pose her with the greatest dare of all&#x2014;to love again.</p><p>Tami Hoag&#39;s novels have appeared regularly on national bestseller lists since the publication of her first book in 1988. She lives in Los Angeles.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>"He can't be single," Mary Margaret McSwain said, adjusting the focus on her binoculars as she peered at the store across the street. "He's too good-looking. It's McSwain's Law: If a man's gorgeous, he has to be married, gay, or a serial killer."<br><br>Zoe Baylor shoved a book of wallpaper samples out of her way and leaned across the oak table, bracing her long dark hands against the window frame as she tried to get a better look without benefit of magnifying lenses.<br><br>"Mary Margaret," Katie Quaid called in a warning tone as she struggled in the back door of the store, her tiny frame weaving under the weight of books of drapery swatches. After the day she'd had, she wouldn't have refused a hand, but her friends seemed too preoccupied to offer. "I don't want to hear another one of your stories about serial killers. Mrs. Pruitt changed her mind again about the color of the guest room. If you describe to me one more brutal way to do away with somebody, no one is liable to find Mrs. Pruitt for a long, long time."<br><br>Katie dropped the drapery samples on her desk with a horrendous crash. Neither of the women staring out the window so much as flinched. The tip of Zoe's nose dotted the plate glass in front of her like that of a hungry kid looking in a bakery window. Katie's business partner, known as Maggie to her friends, was kneeling on her chair, her well-rounded bottom sticking up as she leveled a pair of binoculars at some point across the street.<br><br>"Maggie, what on earth are you doing?" Katie asked. She knew her friend already had a solidly established reputation for being a flake. Spying on people with binoculars was not going to improve matters.<br><br>"I'm spying on the Adonis in the store across the street." Maggie sighed and moaned, never lowering her binoculars. "Haven't you heard? That old building was sold two days ago."<br><br>"Who bought it?"<br><br>Maggie sat back with her legs tucked under her and offered the binoculars to Katie, deftly untangling the neck strap from the ends of her bobbed red hair. The smile that tilted her mouth was challenging. "See for yourself."<br><br>Katie rolled her eyes and propped a fist on her slender hip. "I will not stoop to window peeping."<br><br>"Chicken."<br><br>Muttering under her breath, Katie grabbed the field glasses from her friend and raised them to her eyes. Would she always be such a sucker for a dare? Probably. It had something to do with being only five feet one and seven-eighths inches tall. Being the first one to take a dare had always been her way of compensating for her lack of stature. That she was twenty-seven and had long since considered herself a grown woman had no effect on the trait.<br><br>"If this isn't the silliest thing you've . . ." The rest of her breath washed out of her on the softest of sighs as she focused the binoculars.<br><br>The dark T-shirt might have been painted on him. Even looking through the window of her store and the bay window of the store across the street, Katie could see the outline of his chest muscles, a wide expanse of hard, rippling pectorals. He was dancing as he washed the inside of the window. His breathtaking chest tapered to a narrow waist, and then to hips that were gently gyrating in time to the tune he was listening to on his headphones. He had the kind of body that was made for faded jeans&#x2014;a flat belly, a perfectly rounded male fanny, slim hips, and muscular thighs.<br><br>Before Katie could dwell on any other part of his lower anatomy, she jerked the glasses up to his face. She might have lost her breath again, except she hadn't been breathing. Inky black hair tumbled onto his forehead, lending his male beauty a roguish quality. Maggie hadn't been far wrong calling him an Adonis. His was the kind of face ancient Greek sculptors would have fought over to immortalize in marble.<br><br>"His name is Nick Leone," Maggie said, as if it were the most dangerously mysterious name she'd ever heard. "He's from New Jersey. Lee Henry Bartell heard it from Dee Roberts, the real estate agent who sold him the property."<br><br>"What's he doing in Briarwood?" Zoe asked suspiciously. In a nervous habit she ran a forefinger back and forth over the plastic name tag on her nurse's uniform.<br><br>Katie forced herself to plunk the binoculars down on the table, embarrassed over her own involuntary reaction to the handsome stranger. She was no drooling man watcher; she had a business to run. "He must not know about the law against people from New Jersey moving to Virginia," she said in a teasing voice.<br><br>Zoe was too wrapped up in her musings to hear. "I thought he sounded like a Yankee," she murmured.<br><br>Maggie jumped on the comment like a cat on a june bug. "You heard him talk? You met him? Where? What's he like? He doesn't have a funny voice, does he? That would just ruin it for me if he had a funny voice. Where'd you see him?"<br><br>A horrified look came over Zoe's long, thin face. "Nowhere."<br><br>"The hospital." Maggie nodded, her brown eyes narrowing in thought. "Hmmm, that's interesting. What was he there for?"<br><br>"Maggie!" Zoe exclaimed. "You know I can't talk about patients. It's not ethical."<br><br>"And it's none of your business, Mary Margaret," Katie added pointedly. "Have you called in the order for that grass paper John Harris wants in his office?"<br><br>"Yes. You know what the rumor is about him?"<br><br>"I don't want to hear any rumors about John Harris," Katie said, deliberately misinterpreting Maggie's question. She had a feeling the less she knew about the gorgeous arrangement of masculinity across the street, the better off she'd be. She scooped a couple of wallpaper books off the long table and returned them to their proper slots in the oak case along the wall.<br><br>"Not John Harris, Nick Leone!"<br><br>"Lord, Mary Margaret, the man hasn't been in town a week, and already there's gossip about him?" Katie pulled out a book of miniature country prints and headed for her desk. "I wonder if he knows what he's in for, moving to a small town."<br><br>"Rumor has it he's a mole." She raised her carefully plucked eyebrows for emphasis.<br><br>Katie ignored her, sitting down to page through the book, concentrating on paisley prints in order to get her mind off perfect male pectorals. Zoe shrugged. "I don't get it."<br><br>Maggie heaved a sigh. "A spy for the Company, an agent for the CIA. You know, double O, licensed to kill. They're called moles. Don't you ever go to the movies?"<br><br>"The CIA," Zoe whispered, rubbing her name tag. "I heard he was a fashion model."<br><br>"Oh, please," Katie said, laughing at her friends' wild imaginations. "I don't know which one of you is worse. Maggie, how can you make such a ridiculous remark?"<br><br>"I'm only telling you what I heard, sugar. Lee Henry told me that Dee said the man was very reluctant to discuss himself, and when she asked him what he used to do up in New Jersey, he wouldn't exactly say."<br><br>"That's all?" Katie questioned, trying to suppress a grin. "Lee Henry didn't see him talking into the secret phone in the heel of his shoe?"<br><br>Zoe muttered to herself, "So that's how he came by that gunshot wound."<br><br>"Gunshot wound!" Maggie bolted out of her chair to lean across the table and over her friend.<br><br>"Oh, damn! Don't tell anyone I told you!"<br><br>"A gunshot wound. What do you have to say about that, Katie Quaid?"<br><br>Katie wouldn't have shown her surprise at the news for anything. She kept her eyes glued to the flowered paper in front of her. "He was probably shot by some flighty woman who heard a wild rumor he was a secret agent. Maybe he had a hunting accident. Maybe he's a retired police officer. Maybe&#x2014;"<br><br>"&#x2014;we should find out for ourselves," Maggie interrupted smoothly, lifting the binoculars to her eyes again. She zoomed them in on Katie. "I'm leaning toward the story that he's in the federal witness-protection program. But in the interest of truth, I vote Katie our official ambassador and spy."<br><br>"I second," Zoe said, nodding enthusiastically as she caught Maggie's wink.<br><br>"Nominations cease. Go check him out, Katie."<br><br>"Don't be absurd." She shot Maggie a look from beneath lowered brows. They had been friends since their freshman year at William and Mary. Katie had no doubt that Maggie had caught her automatic response to Nick Leone and had decided to exercise her self-appointed role of fairy godmother.<br><br>"What? Are you scared? Do you secretly believe he's a double agent?" Maggie asked, pushing all the right buttons inside Katie without the slightest compunction. "I dare you to go find out."<br>Nick was happily lost in thought as he washed the dirt off the panes of the bay window. Wash, rinse, polish dry, move a little to the tunes from his favorite musical group&#x2014;what a great life. Not many guys _thirty-_two years old were able to say they were living out one of their life dreams. He hadn't made it big on Broadway&#x2014;that had been his first dream&#x2014;but he'd given it his best shot. His second dream had been to start his own restaurant in a small, quiet town. He'd signed the papers on the beginning of that dream two days ago.<br><br>A lot of people thought he was nuts. His friends back home had been sure he would be massacred by wild men if he moved to Virginia. They had seemed genuinely uncertain as to whether Briarwood, Virginia, had as yet benefited from electricity and indoor plumbing.<br><br>As far as Nick was concerned, Briarwood had it all over any big city. He had been born and raised in Atlantic City and had spent much of his adult life in New York City, but in his heart he always had thought of himself as a small-town boy. The performer in him had yearned for bright lights, but offstage he had found cities could be lonely, unfriendly, dangerous&#x2014;he rubbed his healing shoulder&#x2014;places. His friends could have the dirty gray streets, the crime, the garbage-haulers' strikes, the pollution. He would take a nice quiet life in a town where people didn't need five locks on their front door.<br><br>Nick had seen for himself how friendly the people in the small town were. Everyone said hello to him on the street. They were talkative&#x2014;slow talkers compared to those he was used to, but they liked to talk. You couldn't buy a candy bar without having to tell at least one person your whole life story.<br><br>A frown creased his brow at this thought. He had evaded their questions as politely as he could. Nick had a feeling the people in the conservative rural community wouldn't understand if he were to tell them what he'd spent the last two years doing.<br><br>"Pardon me," Katie said, stepping through the open front door. He went on polishing the glass in the bay window, his hips swaying seductively. The blue foam pads of his headphones pressed against his ears. They were very nicely shaped ears, she noticed. Her stomach tightened. Immediately she began to scold herself. She wasn't at all a nervous person, and she simply did not ever allow herself to go gaga over a man. There was no point in it. Not even if the small of his back was the sexiest thing she'd ever seen wrapped in a skintight T-shirt.<br><br>Squelching her jitters, Katie crossed to where he was standing and pulled the plug on his music, disconnecting the cord that ran from the headphones into the tiny cassette player that was hooked onto his waistband.<br><br>Suddenly Nick's head swung in her direction. She took an involuntary step back as she felt the impact of his gaze. His eyes were brown&#x2014;a rich coffee brown that darkened to chocolate as he looked at her. His grin was engaging, endearingly crooked, giving a boyish quality to his classic good looks. He pulled the headphones down around his neck.<br><br>"Are you the welcome-wagon lady?" he asked, his gaze shifting to the bouquet of spring flowers in a china vase she clutched before her. Someone should have captured her on canvas, he thought. Standing there in a full flowing skirt and a soft pink sweater with a lace collar, she was as delicate and feminine as the subject of a Renoir painting. Her hair was dark ashen brown, and she wore it pulled back from the fine bones of her face except for a soft fringe of bangs that angled across her forehead. She watched him with huge eyes that were a deep, pure gray.<br><br>Before her wits could scatter too far, Katie reined in her composure. She gave him a polite smile. "No," she said a little breathlessly. "My name is Kathryn Quaid. My store&#x2014;Primarily Paper&#x2014;is across the street from your building."<br><br>"Lucky me." Nick grinned, hoping to elicit a warm response from her. It didn't quite happen. The very corners of her mouth quirked upward, and he caught the hint of a sparkle in her eyes as she glanced away almost shyly.<br><br>"My partner and I want to welcome you to Briarwood, Mr.&#x2014;?" She offered him the bouquet.<br><br>"Leone. Nick Leone," he said, accepting the flowers. He set the vase on the ledge of the bay window and reached out a hand to his new neighbor. "I'm very pleased to meet you, Miss Quaid."<br><br>Katie bit the inside of her lip as she grasped his hand. It was warm and firm. A sensation of heat suffused her as his hand engulfed hers. He hadn't looked quite so large from across the street. No less than a foot taller than she was, he loomed over her. He was nearly as tall as her brother, Rylan.<br><br>I don't want to be attracted to him, she told herself, trying to be practical. She was perfectly content going out with Michael Severs, a civil engineer, on an occasional date. They were good friends. Michael was nice and undemanding, while simply looking at this man had her rattled.<br><br>". . . what kind of store?" Nick's voice broke into her wandering train of thought.<br><br>"Wallpaper and custom draperies," she said, cursing herself up and down. She was certain her lack of composure wasn't showing outwardly to any degree; she had too many years of practice at projecting a controlled image. But inside she was off balance, and she didn't like it. With a strength of will that belied her size she calmly proceeded with the conversation. "My partner and I are interior-design consultants."<br><br>"No kidding? That's great," Nick said, deciding to seize the opportunity as he accepted the business card she had plucked out of her skirt pocket. He studied the thing as if it didn't look like Chinese doodling to him. The fine script of the company name was a blur without his reading glasses, but there was no way he was putting them on now. "You're exactly the person I need."<br><br>Katie refrained from saying he was more in need of an optometrist than a decorator. He was holding her card upside down.<br><br>"Please, Mr. Leone, don't feel as if you're under any obligation to make use of our services simply because we brought you a bouquet." She began inching toward the door. "I'd better be getting back. Again, welcome to Briarwood&#x2014;"</p><h2>Pilgrimage to Murder, A (A Brother Athelstan Medieval Mystery, 17)</h2><p><b><i>Brother Athelstan&#x2019;s Canterbury pilgrimage is disrupted by brutal murder in the latest absorbing medieval mystery.</i></b><br><br>Summer, 1381.

Leading us chapter by chapter through its most important stories--from the Creation and the Tree of Knowledge through the Exodus from Egypt and the journey to the Promised Land--James Kugel shows how a group of anonymous, ancient interpreters radically transformed the Bible and made it into the book that has come down to us today. </p><p>Was the snake in the Garden of Eden the devil, or the Garden itself "paradise"? Did Abraham discover monotheism, and was his son Isaac a willing martyr? Not until the ancient interpreters set to work. Poring over every little detail in the Bible's stories, prophecies, and laws, they let their own theological and imaginative inclinations radically transform the Bible's very nature. Their sometimes surprising interpretations soon became the generally accepted meaning. These interpretations, and not the mere words of the text, <i>became</i> the Bible in the time of Jesus and Paul or the rabbis of the Talmud. </p><p>Drawing on such sources as the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient Jewish apocrypha, Hellenistic writings, long-lost retellings of Bible stories, and prayers and sermons of the early church and synagogue, Kugel reconstructs the theory and methods of interpretation at the time when the Bible was becoming the bedrock of Judaism and Christianity. Here, for the first time, we can witness all the major transformations of the text and recreate the development of the Bible "As It Was" at the start of the Common era--the Bible as we know it.</p></p><p>James Kugel's <i>The Bible As It Was</i> is an eye-opening study of early scriptural interpretation. Kugel focuses on readings of the Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) from 100-300 A.D., particularly the Jewish tradition of <i>midrash</i>--a practice of filling in the narrative gaps where biblical stories are ambiguous or unclear. Kugel's interest in midrash is more than academic, however. He wants readers to consider the ways these early readings of the Bible affect today's popular understandings of scriptural texts (such as the sacrifice of Isaac or the creation in Genesis); and he provides a convincing description of the richness and complexity that informs what seem to many like simple, commonsense readings of scripture.James L. Kugel is a Professor at Bar-Ilan University.</p><h2>Sex, Drugs, Einstein &amp; Elves: Sushi, Psychedelics, Parallel Universes and the Quest for Transcendence</h2><p>A smorgasbord of subjects designed to bend reality and stretch the reader&#39;s mind.</p><p></p><h2>Adventures in Missing the Point: How the Culture-Controlled Church Neutered the Gospel</h2><p><p>How the Culture-Controlled Church Neutered the Gospel If you&#x2019;re brave enough to take an honest look at the issues facing the culture&#x2013;controlled church&#x2015;and the issues in your own life&#x2015;read on. Do you ever look at how the Christian faith is being lived out in the new millennium and wonder if we&#x2019;re not doing what we&#x2019;re supposed to be doing? That we still haven&#x2019;t quite &#x201c;gotten it&#x201d;? That we&#x2019;ve missed the point regarding many important issues?

At least that&#39;s what my friend Jim Henderson says, and he has a story to prove it: I&#39;m in Home Depot. A series of consumer canyons tower menacingly overhead. All I need is a thingamajig. Where is it and who cares? My eyes quickly scan the horizon of stuff looking for a little just-in-time customer service. I want to scream: Take your eyes off those boxes! Get down off that stupid ladder! Quit visiting with your coworkers! Don&#39;t pick up that phone! Pay attention to me! But it&#39;s pointless, and I finally get it: I&#39;m an interruption. An irritation. They&#39;d prefer I wasn&#39;t in their building. They&#39;ve forgotten why they went into business. It wasn&#39;t to count boxes. Or visit each other. Or ignore the customer. They went into business to pay attention to the customer. Employees like these have missed the point. Which is how a lot of us feel about the way we&#39;re living out Christian faith in the early 21st century. Somehow, we&#39;re missing the point. We pastors and preachers listen to our own sermons, see the frantic pace of programs and meetings we&#39;ve created, and shivers run up our spines: are we somehow missing the point? Are our churches and broadcasts and books and organizations merely creating religious consumers of religious products and programs? Are we creating a self-isolating, self- serving, self-perpetuating, self-centered subculture instead of a world-penetrating (like salt and light), world-serving (focused on &#39;the least and the lost,&#39; those Jesus came to seek and save), world-transforming (like yeast in bread), Godcentered (sharing God&#39;s love for the whole world) counterculture? If so, even if we proudly carry the name evangelical (which means &#39;having to do with the gospel&#39;), we&#39;re not behaving as friends to the gospel, but rather as its betrayers. However unintentionally, we can neuter the very gospel we seek to live and proclaim. This book is our attempt, flawed and faltering to be sure, to get us thinking about the frightening possibility of unintentional betrayal of the gospel by those entrusted with it. And more, this book isn&#39;t about pointing fingers at &#39;them&#39; for their mistakes. It&#39;s about us. Protestants and Catholics, liberals and conservatives, hand-clappers and nonclappers, Pentecostals and Presbyterians (and Pentecostal Presbyterians)---all of us. So we&#39;d like to invite all of us to consider ways that we&#39;re missing the point---to share a journey of (re)discovering what we&#39;re supposed to be about. You won&#39;t find a blueprint in these chapters---no five easy steps, no new model to roll out. We&#39;re just two bald guys learning to love the Lord and the church and the world, and we&#39;re trying to figure out the point of being Christians. In the process we&#39;re becoming more and more aware of how often we miss the point ourselves. And on occasion in these pages, you&#39;ll see how each of us thinks the other might be missing the point as well! (And hopefully, you&#39;ll see us demonstrate a good-natured way of disagreeing, too.) Every once in a while, muddling through life, we see things in a new, clearer light, and we&#39;re surprised by the epiphany. Consider the case of Jason, a young college student who, during the time he was attending Brian&#39;s church, was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Soon after the diagnosis he rented a room in Brian&#39;s big house, like a few other single guys (without mental disorders) did. Fast forward a few years. All the guys in Brian&#39;s house have moved out and got places of their own. One day Brian learns from a mutual friend that Jason is &#39;normal&#39; again. The two of them get together, and Brian immediately recognized that something was different: for starters, Jason called him Brian instead of Mr. McLaren, which for some reason he had called him since his illness had kicked in. &#39;Can you explain what I was like when I lived with you?&#39; Jason asked Brian. &#39;I feel like I just woke up from a dream and my whole past is like a fog. I&#39;m trying to piece it together.&#39; During the few hours they were together, Brian felt like he was watching Awakenings, seeing a miracle before his eyes. But as in the movie, the miracle was short-lived, and Jason&#39;s schizophrenia gradually returned. It turned out that a new doctor had changed medications, and during the transition--- when the effects of the old drug were waning and those of the new were increasing---Jason&#39;s brain chemistry returned to that fragile state we call &#39;normal.&#39; Sadly, the doctor has never been able to recapture that fragile balance. Like Jason during that brief period of clarity, we may be in a rare moment of opportunity as a culture. The waning of modernity and the rise of postmodernity may give us a few days or weeks of unusual clarity. We begin to realize what a fog we have been in, how we may have been missing the point. In such lucid moments we might find ourselves in the calm eye of a hurricane---an interlude of clear skies and gentle winds, of clear thinking and improved vision, where we can reassess our lives, re-imagine our future direction. And with any luck, perhaps the pair of cultural influences---one waning and the other waxing---can somehow neutralize each other and somehow make our cultural awakening longer-lived. But shame on you if you use this book to critique others, to point the finger and say, &#39;See how they&#39;re missing the point!&#39; If you do that, you&#39;re missing the point. This adventure is not about finding the splinter in someone else&#39;s eye, not about judging others for their poor vision. Or if you get defensive while reading this book, thinking, Hey, I&#39;m not missing the point. You authors are missing the point. I see everything perfectly clearly---if you think this, then you&#39;re missing more than the point: you&#39;re missing an opportunity to learn, to reflect, to grow. This adventure isn&#39;t about defending ourselves. What this adventure is about is facing our own blindnesses, our own insanities, our own foggy thinking and clouded judgment. It&#39;s about admitting that we haven&#39;t seen things clearly, and about wanting to think more clearly than we do.</p><h2>American Fix: Inside the Opioid Addiction Crisis - and How to End It</h2><p><p>Nearly every American knows someone who has been affected by the opioid crisis. Addiction is a trans-partisan issue that impacts individuals from every walk of life. Millions of Americans, tired of watching their loved ones die while politicians ignore this issue.

Over time the verses were collected to form the <i>Theragatha</i> and <i>Therigatha,</i> the "Verses of Elder Monks" and "Verses of Elder Nuns" respectively. In <i>Songs of the Sons and Daughters of the Buddha</i>, renowned poets Andrew Schelling and Anne Waldman have translated the most poignant poems in these collections, bringing forth the visceral, immediate qualities that are often lost in more scholarly renditions. This updated edition contains new translations, as well as a new introduction and afterword. These selections reveal the fears, loves, mishaps, expectations, and joys of the early monks and nuns, when, struck by wild insight, they cried out the anguish or solace they knew in their lives.</p><p>ANDREW SCHELLING is a poet and translator. Author of twenty-odd books, his poetry is founded on studies in ecology, linguistics, and folklore, and includes <i>A Possible Bag</i>. Recent translations include<i> Some Unquenchable Desire: Sanskrit Poems of the Buddhist Hermit Bhartrihari </i>and<i> Erotic Love Poems from India</i>. Schelling lives in the Southern Rocky Mountain Eco-Zone; he teaches poetry and Sanskrit at Naropa University.<br><br>ANNE WALDMAN is a poet, performer, professor, editor, activist, and founder with Allen Ginsberg of The Jack Kerouac School at Naropa University. Author of over 50 books of poetry, her most recent books include <i>Voice's Daughter of a Heart Yet To Be Born</i>, and <i>Trickster Feminism</i>. Her epic <i>The Iovis Trilogy: Colors in the Mechanism of Concealment</i> won the PEN Center USA Award for Poetry. She has received the Shelley Award, a Guggenheim, the Before Columbus Foundation Award for lifetime achievement, and the Houtian Prize from China. Waldman is a Chancellor Emeritus of the Academy of American Poetry. She has been a student of Buddhism for many decades. She makes frequent trips to India and was a keynote speaker at the Jaipur Literary Festival.</p><h2>The Land Beyond: A Thousand Miles on Foot through the Heart of the Middle East</h2><p><strong>Nominated for the Edward Stanford Travel Awards (Wanderlust Adventure Book of the Year)</strong><br><br>There are many reasons why it might seem unwise to walk, mostly alone, through the Middle East. That, in part, is exactly why Leon McCarron did it.<br><br>From Jerusalem, McCarron followed a series of wild hiking trails that trace ancient trading and pilgrimage routes and traverse some of the most contested landscapes in the world. In the West Bank, he met families struggling to lead normal lives amidst political turmoil and had a surreal encounter with the world&#x2019;s oldest and smallest religious sect. In Jordan he visited the ruins of Hellenic citadels and trekked through the legendary Wadi Rum. His journey culminated in the vast deserts of the Sinai, home to Bedouin tribes and haunted by the ghosts of biblical history. <br><br>McCarron&#x2019;s journey led him back through time, from the quagmire of current geopolitics to the original ideals of the faithful, through the layers of history, culture and religion that have shaped the Holy Land. Along migration and trade routes, pilgrimage trails and Bedouin paths, he found connection rather than division, hope instead of hatred and, ultimately, a shared humanity that borders and politics will never diminish.</p><p>Leon McCarron is a Northern Irish writer, film-maker and speaker. He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and specializes in storytelling via long distance, human-powered expeditions. He has cycled from New York to Hong Kong, walked 3000 miles across China, trekked 1000 miles through the Empty Quarter desert in Arabia and travelled along Iran&#x2019;s longest river. At the end of 2014 he rode a horse across Argentina, following the Santa Cruz river in the footsteps of Charles Darwin. Most recently, McCarron walked from Jerusalem to Mount Sinai to explore another side of the Middle East. His first book, <em>The Road Headed West</em> described a cycling adventure across North America. McCarron has also produced a TV series, Walking Home from Mongolia, for National Geographic and made three independent films. In 2017 he was awarded the Neville Shulman Challenge Award.&#x201c;A marvellous adventure and an impressive feat of endurance. This is also a journey that explores the people and landscapes of a misunderstood part of the world with great insight and enthusiasm.&#x201d; (Sir Ranulph Fiennes)<br><br><p>"It sounds like a fascinating journey, in Jordan visiting the Hellenic citadels and trekking through Wadi Rum, then tackling the vast deserts of Sinai. Through the conversations and encounters he has along the way, he discovers more about the region's rich history, uncertain present, and its myriad faiths and people."</p> (Cond� Nast Traveller 2017-10-02)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Enlightening, engaging and a must read for anyone interested in this area of the world.&#x201d;</p> (Fiona Richards, Timeless Travels Magazine, October 2017)</p><h2>They Used to Call Us Game Wardens volume 2</h2><p>Like volume 1, this volume contains stories written by Bill Callies about his years as a Minnesota Game Warden.

An understanding of the Trinity is essential for the protection and defense of the divine/human person of Jesus Christ and his saving work. This book documents the historical development of the doctrine of the Trinity and its significance for the Christian faith. In a broad and systematic way, Ladaria traces the debates within the early Christian church as the concept of the Trinity developed. He also reflects on the great masters of church tradition concerning their understanding of the Trinity and is in dialogue with various contemporary theologians on this subject. This book has been written especially for theological students and professors as an aid in grasping the Trinitarian formulation both historically and theologically and to assist in deepening their faith and reflection in the mystery of God.</p><p>&#34;The Living and True God: The Mystery of the Trinity discusses Christianity and the development of the concept in the early Christianity, as well as the mystery of God and his role in this trinity offaith. A translation from Spanish from Christian thinker Luis F. Ladaria, this study is an absolute must for students of theology, be they professional or simply curious non-specialist general readers.

The resulting images offer a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse of Billie with her family, friends, and her pet chihuahua, Pepe; playing with her godchild (son of her autobiography&#x2019;s coauthor, William Dufty); washing dishes at the Duftys&#x2019; home; walking the streets of Newark; in her hotel room; waiting backstage or having a drink in front of the stage; and performing. The years and the struggles seem to vanish when she sings; her face lights up. Later that same year, Dantzic photographed her in color at the second New York Jazz Festival at Randall&#x2019;s Island. Only a handful of the photographs in the book have ever been published. In her text, Zadie Smith evokes Lady Day herself and shows us what she sees as she inhabits these images and reveals what she is thinking. 90 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Jerry Dantzic</strong> was a photojournalist whose photographs have appeared in such publications as the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Life</em>, <em>Look</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and <em>American Photo</em>.

With Jerry Dantzic, she revealed homier sides of her life which needed no explanations and invited no judgments: at home with her husband or her dog, or visiting her co-author and her godchild. In these images and in Mr. Dantzic's performance shots, she is not the tragic torch singer of myth but a middle-aged woman finding simple comforts from the maelstrom, no longer as sharp in her voice but undiminished in her ability to command a stage.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New York Times' Lens</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This coffee table book features 100 photos and beautifully captures Holiday on a cigarette-hazed bandstand, wearing a bare-shouldered, sequined dress, performing songs such as &#x2018;Fine and Mellow,&#x2019; &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t Explain,&#x2019; and &#x2018;Strange Fruit.&#x2019; Taken one year after the publication of her autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, and two years before her untimely death at age 44, the photos reveal a deeply personal and vibrant side of Holiday.

It&#x2019;s the everyday nature of these black-and-white photographs that makes them so unusual. [Billie] Holiday is pictured walking into the club before a performance; putting on her makeup in front of a dressing room mirror; being licked on the cheek by her Chihuahua; holding her blond-haired godson in her arms; or leaning over a pan in her friend&#x2019;s kitchen. British novelist Zadie Smith, who sang jazz before she began publishing fiction, provides a curious introduction to the book: a short story written from Holiday&#x2019;s point of view.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Recommended for photography enthusiasts, fans of Holiday, and jazz history buffs. Dantzic's intimate portraits honor this period in Holiday' life, just two years before her untimely death at age 44. Often shooting indoors and with a slow shutter, he captures a good deal of motion blur that give the images a gritty look and feel. When Holiday is performing, Dantzic frequently shoots from a low vantage point to emphasize her larger-than-life stature. Dantzic also provides a rare view into the everyday life of this mythic performer, which includes playing with her Chihuahua Pepi, walking in New York City, interacting with friends, and cooking in her West 68th Street apartment.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] remarkable set of images of one of America's greatest artists. If you're a Holiday fan, it will be hard to resist seeking out this book that so candidly captures her late in her life and career. The images are intimate but not prurient. Too often fans want to see the flaws, the scars and wear-and-tear of a well-documented difficult life, as if those struggles alone defined Holiday. The book shows us much more. Likely influenced by Dantzic's relationship with William Dufty (her friend and the co-author of her autobiography, <em>Lady Sings the Blues</em>), Holiday gave the photographer nearly unprecedented access.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Jazz Times</em></strong></p><h2>The Voyage: A Novel</h2><p>In the tradition of great seafaring adventures, <b>The Voyage</b> is an intricately plotted, superbly detailed, and gripping story of adventure and courage. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Philip Caputo has written a timeless novel about the dangerous reverberating effects of long held family secrets.<br><br>On a June morning in 1901, Cyrus Braithwaite orders his three sons to set sail from their Maine home aboard the family's forty-six-foot schooner and not return until September. Though confused and hurt by their father's cold-blooded actions, the three brothers soon rise to the occasion and embark on a breathtakingly perilous journey down the East Coast, headed for the Florida Keys.<br><br>Almost one hundred years later, Cyrus's great-granddaughter Sybil sets out to uncover the events that transpired on the voyage. Her discoveries about the Braithwaite family and the America they lived in unfolds into a stunning tale of intrigue, murder, lies and deceit.</p><p>The title voyage of Philip Caputo's sweeping new novel commences under exceedingly strange circumstances: in June 1900, Cyrus Braithwaite, a gruff Yankee granite magnate, orders his three teenage sons to board the family's beloved schooner, sail away from their imposing Maine summer home, and stay away until September. His sole explanation for this sudden expulsion: "It's a new century, boys." Puzzled, abashed, but also intrigued by the adventure forced upon them, Nathaniel, Eliot, and Andrew leave behind their privileged WASP childhood and head out to sea--bound, they decide more or less on a whim, for the Florida keys.<p> Adventures are slow to shape themselves at first, but once the Braithwaite boys enlist the help of blond, worldly wise Yale dropout Will Terhune, the pace quickens considerably. Nat, who serves as skipper, and is also the most naive and most ambitious of the brothers, nearly dies in a bar fight in lower Manhattan. Fourteen-year-old Drew, the seasick-prone family rationalist, discovers a penchant for cold-blooded violence. Caught in a blow off the Carolinas, the boys limp the damaged schooner into Beaufort, South Carolina, their mother's birthplace, where an ancient aunt invites them to dinner and hints darkly at family secrets. Then, about two-thirds of the way in, what has seemed a leisurely coming-of-age story explodes into an elemental drama as a hurricane swallows the boat and spits it out on the desolate coast of Cuba. This, as it turns out, is but the first in a series of terrible reversals.</p><p> <i>The Voyage</i> is a departure for Caputo, a former foreign correspondent who made his name with a Vietnam memoir (<i>A Rumor of War</i>), and he does a fine job of conjuring up an age "when both the awareness of death and the hope of salvation were writ on every face." True, his framing device of a present-day Braithwaite descendant delving into her family's secret history is a bit forced and yes, the characters could use more depth. No matter. At some point, <i>The Voyage</i> becomes irresistible. <i>--David Laskin</i></p><br>A conversation with Philip Caputo, author of <b>The Voyage</b><br><br><b>Q</b>: What inspired you to write a novel that begins with three young boys being<br>mysteriously sent off to sea by their own father?<br><b>A</b>: The seed was planted by my late father-in- law, John Ware, a few years ago. He told me that he had just heard an intriguing tale from his first cousin. Back in 1899, their grandfather, one William Mimms Ware, had put three of his four sons on a schooner called <i>Holly</i>, gave each ten dollars, and told them to sail away and not return until September. The boys, ages 15, 13, and 12 (the youngest was John Ware's father, Edward Winslow Ware) left Hull, Massachusetts in June, and were not heard from until August, when a telegram from the American Legation in Havana was delivered to their father, informing him that his sons had been caught in a hurricane, shipwrecked on the Cuban coast, and rescued by Cuban fishermen. William then wired money to Havana for the boys' passage home.<br><br>That was as much as my father-in-law knew. The tale begged a lot of questions: Why did<br>William send the boys off on a dangerous voyage, without adult supervision? Where was their<br>mother, and what did she think of such an unusual and risky idea? Why had my father-in-law's<br>father never told his family about this astonishing adventure? I had been taking notes for some time for a series of novels and stories about an old Yankee clan the Braithwaites of Massachussetts and Maine with a dark, secret history. My imagination eventually integrated my father-in-law's true story with the fictional story of the Braithwaites, and The Voyage was born. I want to stress that Cyrus Braithwaite's motives were not those of William M. Ware, and that the Braithwaites' history is in no way intended to be a fictionalized history of the Wares.<br><br><b>Q</b>: What sort of research went into <b>The Voyage</b> -- both in terms of the nautical details (from ship maintenance; to navigation; to storm patterns etc.) and also in terms of recreating life at the turn of the century in places such as Maine, downtown New York City, Key West, and Cuba?<br><b>A</b>: The research was a combination of direct experience, interviews, and extensive reading. I've been a deep-sea fisherman for years, and have done some day-sailing, so I know something about boats, ships, and the sea. The considerable gaps in my knowledge were filled in by interviewing veteran yachtsmen and sailors like my father-in-law, and by reading a number of books and magazine articles, most of which are listed on the acknowledgements page of the<br>novel. But no amount of time spent in the library can substitute for hands-on experience.<br><br>Realizing that I didn't know what it was like to pilot a sailboat on a long ocean passage, I signed<br>up (in May, 1997) as a crewman on a yacht delivery from St. Marten, in the French West Indies,<br>to Newport, R.I. The vessel was a 52-foot Swan, and the 1,800-mile passage took a little under two weeks. The skipper, Capt. Andy Burton, and the mate, Herb Matthews, taught me the basics of celestial navigation and helmsmanship. It was a fairly uneventful trip, though we did encounter a 40-knot gale and 12-foot seas while crossing the Gulf Stream. The next summer, as a kind of refresher course in blue-water sailing, I helped Burton deliver a 48-foot sloop from Bermuda to Newport, a five-day passage.<br><br>The stuff about turn-of-the-century Maine, New York, Cuba, and Key West was gleaned from old photographs and from history and travel books. Also, I made three trips to Havana in 1978, 1979, and 1980, and as old Havana had changed little (except to grow much shabbier), I was able to draw on my travel notes and memories as well. <br><br><b>Q</b>: When Cyrus Braithwaite puts his sons upon the sea the only explanation he offers is the cryptic remark, "It's a new century, boys. Yes indeed, a brand new century;" a comment all of his sons wrestle with throughout their journey. What is the significance of setting this story at the start of a new century and also of your writing it on the eve of yet another new century?<br><b>A</b>: No cosmic significance here. I thought that readers in the closing months of the 20th century would find it interesting to read a novel set in the century's beginning when the automobile, electricity, telephones, and other innovations were regarded with the same breathless excitement as computers and the Internet are regarded today. Cyrus' comment was meant to suggest that the brand new century, which was greeted with such optimism, contained dark possibilities as well as bright ones.<br><br><b>Q</b>: There are ideas in this novel about the nature of exile and also about the experiences that turn boys into men -- and the innocence that exists before the world has shown itself to be indifferent to our fates -- that you have dealt with before in your writing. How would you compare <br><b>The Voyage</b> to your previous books?<br><b>A</b>: The theme of exile or estrangement has been in almost everything I've written, particularly in <b>Horn of Africa</b>, <b>Indian Country</b>, and, obviously, in <b>Exiles</b>. Loss of innocence and the rite of passage from boyhood to manhood informs <b>A Rumor of War</b>. That said, I regard <b>The Voyage</b> as completing a process of departure from my previous work that was begun with the first two novellas in <b>Exiles</b>. The major themes in my first six books were war and its after effects on individuals and society -- war in general and the Vietnam War in particular. I have for years loved the sea and wanted to write a "sea story," but Vietnam had such a grip on my imagination that I wasn't able to until recently.<br><br><b>Q</b>: There is a long literary tradition of stories about the sea (from Noah to the Greek classics to <b>Moby Dick</b> and <b>The Old Man and The Sea</b>). Did you have any of those works in mind while writing this book?<br><b>A</b>: <b>The Voyage</b> is in large part a re-imagining of Apollonius of Rhodes' Voyage of the Argonauts, which in turn was based on the ancient Greek myth of Jason and the Golden Fleece. My novel doesn't slavishly follow its classical model in every detail, but there are several episodes and passages that directly parallel those in the myth; e.g. the golden fleece becomes the paschal candles the boys believe to be in the sunken ship, the Annisquam. Similarly, some of the characters are modern versions of the ancient heroes: Cyrus is King Pelias, Nathaniel is Jason, Eliot is Orpheus, Elvira, the santeria priestess, is Medea, the witch who is spirited off from her cruel father by the Argonauts. But again, the parallels are not exact, and not intended to be.<br><br><b>Q</b>: Readers seem to have an enormous hunger for adventure stories, and even more specifically for stories about the sea, what do you think accounts for that?<br><b>A</b>: America was a wild frontier not very long ago, in historical time. Today, an awful lot of<br>it is shopping malls and theme parks linked by Interstates. And life in the No-Smoking,<br>Buckle-Up, Litigious America of the Ever-Rising Dow has become so luxurious, safe, and<br>foolproof that it's numbingly dull. People have developed a craving for danger, risk, and<br>unpredictability. Most seek to satisfy this craving vicariously, in books and movies and computer games, but some seek to assauge their hunger directly, in "extreme" sports like skiing off cliffs or climbing mountains.<br><br>It's a paradox. Americans seem driven to make their lives ever more comfortable and secure, but once they do, they discover that something essential is missing -- an edge, a poignancy, a chance to test their mettle. They feel less alive and hunger for the excitement of the unknown, for the power of untamed nature. The sea, like the mountains, is one part of the natural world that has not been domesticated.<br><br><b>Q</b>: Do you think that in the past it was possible to have a certain kind of adventure -- to take a kind of voyage to unfamiliar territory -- that science and exploration and technology has made pretty much impossible these days?<br><b>A</b>: Yes. To experience the thrill of discovery we must now resort to artifice. For example, I<br>took a five-day solo backpacking trip in New Mexico's Gila Wilderness last year, on assignment for <i>Men's Journal</i>. I went to the least-traveled part of the Gila, avoided using trails whenever possible, and navigated by map and compass rather than relying on a GPS. Why? Because I wanted the unfamiliar and the untrodden. Trails are banal. Also, I didn't want to know where I was right down to the yard. But all the time I was aware that I was artificially imposing<br>restrictions and difficulties on myself. In the past, I would not have had any choice.<br><br><b>Q</b>: As the boys travel South, you explore the contrast of a New England reserve vs. a Southern sensuality as well as the idea of logic vs. instinct. Do you think each of us is inherently programmed to veer more towards one of these poles than the other?<br><b>A</b>: In a word, yes. It's the old business of the tension between right brain and left brain,<br>romanticism and rationalism, earth and air.<br><br><b>Q</b>: Why did you structure this novel as a history of the Braithwaite family (as pieced <br>together by one of their descendants -- living in the 1990s) rather than as a straight <br>narrative?<br><b>A</b>: The Braithwaites embody the Puritan or Protestant ethic, the Anglo-Saxon ideals that<br>were the cultural and social templates for America right up through WWII. Immigrants from southern and eastern Europe -- Jews, Italians, Poles, etc. -- found this ethic and ideal congenial and sought to imitate them in their own lives through the process of assimilation. In the post-war period, but particularly after Vietnam and the 60s, the WASP lost his hegemony over our society. His inherited right to rule and his values came to be questioned, and in some cases, discarded as feminists, blacks, hispanics, and so forth began to demand equality on their terms. <br><br>I wanted to set the boys' experiences at sea in a specific historical and cultural context,<br>without which the tale of their voyage would be merely an adventure story. Structuring the novel as I did, the voyage becomes a long episode in the their family's history, which in many ways parallels the history of America. The boys set off to sea at a time when American society was almost exclusively white, Protestant, and patriarchal, and that is contrasted with the America of their descendant, Sybil Braithwaite -- an America that is far more diverse and feminized but also less coherent and orderly.<br><br><b>Q</b>: Several of the women in this novel are keeping pretty major secrets about their own families and yet it is a woman who eventually fills in the blanks of this strange voyage. Were you exploring how women, as opposed to men, act as the guardians of family secrets and also truths?<br><b>A</b>: Anyone who reads this novel should feel free to impart to it any meaning he or she<br>chooses. If I was exploring this idea, I wasn't doing so consciously; however, now that you've<br>brought it up, I think it's fair to compare Sybil with her great-grandmother, Elizabeth. The <br>social circumstances Elizabeth found herself in, the times she lived in, compelled her to be secretive and duplicitous. Sybil, on the other hand, is not under such constraints, and thus is free to pursue and expose the truth.<br><br><b>Q</b>: You play with the idea that families have a "genetic memory." What do you mean <br>by that?<br><b>A</b>: Basically, that just as a writer can imagine himself or herself into the lives of a novel's<br>characters, so can some people imagine what their ancestors' lives were like, and through the<br>power of imagination, reach reasonably truthful conclusions about them.<br><br><b>Q</b>: You describe the earlier generations of the Braithwaite family as having, "that air of belonging to an America that belonged to them." What does that idea and this novel really say about how this country and how our understanding of the concept of family has changed over the past century?<br><b>A</b>: The Braithwaites, as a family, are something of an anachronism -- they're an extended family, a clan, a tribe. Most families today are either nuclear families or single-parent families -- <br>the equivalent of sub-atomic particles. There is a far greater degree of anomie in modern America. We've become a nation of isolates, with shallow roots and sketchy histories and uncertain ancestries. America is a lonelier place than it was in our grandparents' and great-grandparents' day. It's lonelier than I when I grew up in the 1950s and early 1960s.</p><h2>Jeff Beck: Crazy Fingers</h2><p>The definitive, unauthorized biography of Jeff Beck!

Its urgent message should be widely read and acted upon.</p> (Bron Taylor <i>author of <i>Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future</i></i>)<br><br><p>In this challenging anthology, coeditors Philip Cafaro and Eileen Crist, together with some two dozen contributors, resolutely confront what until quite recently has been the 'toxic third rail' in far too many discussions of humanity's environmental past, present, and future. The book's principal concern and recurrent theme is how 'wild nature,' the totality of life's biological diversity, ecological complexity, and evolutionary dynamism, will survive and flourish in the face of a rapidly expanding global human enterprise (i.e., modern agricultural/industrial/technological civilization). As the title suggests, confronting ongoing population growth is of critical importance. Simply stated, the authors persuasively argue that global human numbers&#x2015;along with excessive per capita consumption&#x2015;must initially be slowed, then stabilized, and subsequently reduced as rapidly and as humanely possible to levels consistent with the earth's longer-term sustainable carrying capacity, a number that may well turn out to be in the one to three billion range.</p> (J. Kenneth Smail <i>professor emeritus of anthropology, Kenyon College</i>)<br><br><p><i>Life on the Brink</i> is a timely and valuable volume, bringing together an impressive set of cutting-edge essays by leading scholars from a wide range of disciplines. The essays address human population growth and issues associated with it from a variety of important (and all-too-often overlooked) perspectives. The work here is empirically well grounded and goes well beyond tired claims that overconsumption is the problem of the wealthy nations, while overpopulation is the problem of those that are developing, or that 'business-as-usual' development alone will inevitably lead to a desirable outcome for the human population. Cafaro and Crist have brought together a volume that will be of great interest for any scholars working on development, population, and environmental issues; indeed, most all of the essays would also be very useful in advanced undergraduate or graduate courses in these areas.</p> (Jason Kawall <i>associate professor of philosophy and environmental studies, Colgate University</i>)<br><br><p>[<i>Life on the Brink</i>] provides evidence that the world&#x2019;s populations must listen to its scientists/researchers and take action to save Earth. Its poignant message makes it an important resource for all students.</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>Any environmental science or social issues collection will find <i>Life on the Brink</i> packs in much food for classroom discussion, debate, and thought.</p> (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br><p>All of the diverse threats to biological diversity are ultimately caused by an increasing human population and a rising standard of living. In <i>Life on the Brink</i>, the authors ask us to consider that the major environmental, social, and economic problems of the world could be dealt with more easily if the human population stabilized or even began to shrink.

His perspectives began to change in the late 1920's and in his book A Study on Dispensationalism he examines his central protest against dispensationalism: that it wrecks the solidarity and materialness of Scripture.</p> <p>Arthur Walkington Pink was an English Christian evangelist and Biblical researcher known for his staunchly Calvinist and Puritan-like teachings. In spite of the fact that he was born to Christian parents, before his conversion he entered into a Theosophical society (a mysterious gnostic gathering common in England amid that time), and rapidly climbed inside their ranks.</p> <p>Change in his spiritual life came from his father's patient admonitions from Scripture. It was the verse, Proverbs 14:12, 'there is a way which seemeth acceptable unto a man, yet the end thereof are the methods for death,' which especially struck his heart and forced him to repudiate Theosophy and take after Jesus.</p></p><p></p><h2>Another Important Book</h2><p><p><strong>In a playful voice that is uniquely Margaret Wise Brown's comes this delightful picture book about just what it means to be six, five, four, three, one, two, and "most importantly" you.</strong></p><p>Caldecott Honor Medalist Chris Raschka's innovative illustrations burst with energy and dance along with Brown's whimsical verses of discovery.</p><p><strong>"</strong>Energetic artwork and vivacious verse delineate the wonders children discover and the milestones they reach, from ages one to six.

One moment she's elated, the next, she's in tears. And she can't figure out why. Maybe her wildly changing moods are tied to the sudden and unaccountable appearance of the swans, which hold the rapt attention of Charlie, Sara's mentally handicapped brother, who she loves far more than herself these days. In fact, it will be the sudden disappearance of Charlie that will compel Sara to abandon her own small, annoying miseries, and lose herself in searching for him. In her anguish, Sara turns to Joe Melby, whom she has long despised, and together they search through the dense woods and rough fields to find him.

"In all of my school years, . . . not one single teacher ever said to me, 'Perhaps you should consider becoming a writer,'" Byars recalls. "Anyway, I didn't want to be a writer. Writing seemed boring. You sat in a room all day by yourself and typed. If I was going to be a writer at all, I was going to be a foreign correspondent like Claudette Colbert in <b>Arise My Love</b>. I would wear smashing hats, wisecrack with the guys, and have a byline known round the world. My father wanted me to be a mathematician." So Byars set out to become mathematician, but when she couldn't grasp calculus in college, she turned to English. Even then, writing was not on her immediate horizon.<p>First, she married and started a family. The writing career didn't emerge until she was 28, a mother of two children, and living in a small place she called the barracks apartment, in Urbana, Illinois. She and her husband, Ed, had moved there in 1956 so he could attend graduate school at the University of Illinois. She was bored, had no friends, and so turned to writing to fill her time. Byars started writing articles for <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, <i>Look</i>,and other magazines. As her family grew and her children started to read, she began to write books for young people and, fortunately for her readers, discovered that there was more to being a writer than sitting in front of a typewriter.</p><p>"Making up stories and characters is so interesting that I'm never bored. Each book has been a different writing experience. It takes me about a year to write a book, but I spend another year thinking about it, polishing it, and making improvements.

The book strives to underscore critical connections between multiple dimensions of Turner&#x2019;s legacy (as scholar, activist, institution-builder, teacher, and mentor), while also aiming to contribute to the growing historicized literature on the Black Studies movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The contributors to this book hope to influence this early phase in Black/Africana Studies historiography and provide a resource for discourse on the future of the discipline.</p></p><p>Scot Brown is Assistant Professor of History at UCLA. His writings on African American resistance, social movements, and cultural nationalism have appeared in the &#34;Black Scholar&#34;, &#34;American National Biography&#34;, &#34;Journal of Black Studies&#34;, &#34;Journal of Negro History&#34; and &#34;Contributions in Black Studies&#34;."This book will be a must read for courses on Africana Studies as it presents indispensable insight into development of the field (discipline).... Although certainly influenced by Turner's work, his students provide a critical reading and assessment of his theoretical and methodological interventions.... This [is a] distinctly important work for understanding the development and interpretation of Africana Studies and for an appreciation of the scholar and activist, James Turner." -Robert L. Harris, professor emeritus of African American history, Cornell University "This book could not have been timelier. As anti-black violence and anti-racist student protests take center stage (again), Africana Studies takes on greater urgency. These powerful and incisive essays not only consider James Turner's extraordinary intellectual legacy but offer reflections on the future of Black Studies and the world. In keeping with Turner's vision and Scot Brown's excellent introduction, Discourse on Africana Studies reminds us that the epistemologies governing Black Studies are always born in struggle." -Robin D. G. Kelley, author of freedom dreams: the black radical imagination "This volume is a fitting tribute to a pioneer who is a true long distance runner in the development of the discipline of Africana Studies. It is an impressive work that is a significant contribution to Africana Studies, social movements, intellectual thought and social advocacy." -Delores P. Aldridge, Founding Director and Grace Towns Hamilton Distinguished Professor Emerita of Sociology and African American Studies, Emory University. "This volume is remarkable....

In the first years of nationhood, Philip Freneau and Sarah Wentworth Morton peopled their works with Indian phantoms, as did Charles Brocken Brown, Washington Irving, Samuel Woodworth, Lydia Maria Child, James Fenimore Cooper, William Apess, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and others who followed. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Native American ghosts figured prominently in speeches attributed to Chief Seattle, Black Elk, and Kicking Bear. Today, Stephen King and Leslie Marmon Silko plot best-selling novels around ghostly Indians and haunted Indian burial grounds. Ren�e L. Bergland argues that representing Indians as ghosts internalizes them as ghostly figures within the white imagination. Spectralization allows white Americans to construct a concept of American nationhood haunted by Native Americans, in which Indians become sharers in an idealized national imagination. However, the problems of spectralization are clear, since the discourse questions the very nationalism it constructs. Indians who are transformed into ghosts cannot be buried or evaded, and the specter of their forced disappearance haunts the American imagination. Indian ghosts personify national guilt and horror, as well as national pride and pleasure. Bergland tells the story of a terrifying and triumphant American aesthetic that repeatedly transforms horror into glory, national dishonor into national pride.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. LC 99-35382REN�E L.

A few mishaps later, it's clear that Cordier isn't the only one wanting something from the notorious Francesca, who fled England following an affair that left her humiliated, divorced and friendless. Lord Elphick, her ex-husband, is a man with multiple mistresses and great political ambitions. Cordier's mission and Francesca's inability to ever trust a man again lead the two into a marvelously and intricately danced tango of a romance. An Italian woman with a penchant for emeralds, a grudge against Cordier and a misguided love for Lord Elphick sweetens the pot, but Chase hones in on her leads admirably. The two delight with sparkling dialogue, sizzling sex appeal and a surprising amount of pathos. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By 1669, the VOC was the richest private company the world had ever seen. This landmark study looks at perhaps the most important tool in the Company&#x2019; trading - its ships. In order to reconstruct the complete shipping activities of the VOC, the author created a unique database of the ships' movements, including frigates and other, hitherto ingored, smaller vessels. Parthesius&#x2019;s research into the routes and the types of ships in the service of the VOC proves that it was precisely the wide range of types and sizes of vessels that gave the Company the ability to sail &#x2013; and continue its profitable trade - the year round. Furthermore, it appears that the VOC commanded at least twice the number of ships than earlier historians have ascertained. Combining the best of maritime and social history, this book will change our understanding of the commercial dynamics of the most successful economic organization of the period.</p><p>Robert Parthesius is a naval historian and director of the Centre for International Heritage Activities in Leiden.</p><h2>Bad Machinery Vol. 8: The Case of the Modern Men (8)</h2><p><b>"A delightfully quirky series whose eccentric charms haven't faltered." - KIRKUS</b><br> <br> From the bestselling author of <i>Giant Days</i> comes the latest pocket-sized volume in his beloved <i>Bad Machinery</i> series!&nbsp;<br><br>It's that classic feud: mods versus rockers!

Many of its important buildings figure prominently in the oeuvres of leading American architects: Latrobe, Robert Mills, Maximilien Godefroy, Richard Upjohn, Stanford White, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe among them. Yet Baltimore's distinctive urban environment also owes much to the achievements of local talents, including Robert Cary Long Sr. and Jr., John Rudolph Niernsee and James Crawford Neilson, E. Francis Baldwin and Josias Pennington, Laurence Hall Fowler, Alexander Cochran&#x2015;not to mention generations of skilled craftsmen and builders.</p><p>Baltimore's architecture rewards close study, and in <i>The Architecture of Baltimore</i> contributors and editors Mary Ellen Hayward and Frank R. Shivers, Jr., have brought together an impressive group of scholars, writers, and critics to provide a fresh account of the city's architectural history. The narrative begins by looking at eighteenth-century Georgian buildings that reflect the grandeur of the style, goes on to the prosperous port city's Federal-period achievements, including many country houses with their delicate details, then proceeds to Baltimore's monumental contributions to early nineteenth-century American neoclassical design. Romantic stylings follow, with excursions into the Greek and Gothic Revivals, and the popular Italianate-mode for town and country houses, the soaring spires of churches, and the classical dignity of public spaces like the Peabody Library. Later in the nineteenth century a picturesque eclecticism produced such monuments as the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad's Mount Royal Station, as well as intriguing changes to the city's versatile row houses. Contributors discuss the evolution of industrial buildings and the growth of the city's architectural profession. <i>The Architecture of Baltimore</i> also addresses the arrival of modernism in Charm City, examines the origins and challenges of historic preservation, and assesses the Baltimore renaissance of the period 1955-2000, which saw the construction of Charles Center, Harborplace, and the sports complex at Camden Yards.</p><p>Here at last we have a comprehensive guide to Baltimore's architectural heritage&#x2015;lost and still-standing alike. Illustrated with nearly 600 photographs, architectural plans, maps, and details, this impressive work of scholarship also offers an engaging narrative of the history of Baltimore itself&#x2015;its men and women of all stations, its taste and traditional preferences, its good choices and lamentable ones, and its built environment as a social and cultural chronicle.</p></p><p><p><b>Mary Ellen Hayward </b>holds advanced degrees from the Winterthur Program in Early American Culture and Boston University.

D. James, the &#34;Queen of the English mystery novel&#34; (Newsweek) joins forces with historian T. A. Critchley to re-create the Radcliffe Highway murders, a series of vicious crimes committed in 1811 ... The scene is the London Docks near Wapping Old Stairs, a sinister neighborhood where pirates were often hanged. The first victims were two hardworking shopkeepers, along with their baby and shop boy. Twelve days later and only a few blocks away, an equally blameless pub owner was found together with his wife and servant, victims of equal cruelty and apparent absence of motive. The serial killings provoked nationwide notoriety and panic. With the atmosphere and pacing of her best novels, James reveals the rudimentary police system of Regency London coping with a major murder investigation -- and crimes that rank up there with Jack the Ripper, the Boston Strangler, and Son of Sam as the very symbol of murderous and unthinking brutality.</p><p>P. D. James was a bestselling and internationally acclaimed crime writer. She was the creator of Adam Dalgliesh and Cordelia Gray, and their long and successful series of mysteries. Her works include Cover Her Face (1962), An Unsuitable Job for a Woman (1972), Innocent Blood (1980), Children of Men (1992), and the Jane Austen-inspired Death Comes to Pemberley (2011).James was born in Oxford in 1920. She won awards for crime writing in Britain, America, Italy and Scandinavia, including the Mystery Writers of America Grandmaster Award. She received honorary degrees from seven British universities, was awarded an OBE in 1983 and created a life peer in 1991. In 1997 she was elected President of the Society of Authors, and stood down from this role in 2013.In 1811, London's East End was the scene of a series of murders so brutal and irrational that they caused panic throughout the city, which lacked a central police force. This engrossing account, marking the American nonfiction debut of British mystery novelist James, details the seven vicious ("brains battered out and throats butchered"), apparently motiveless slayings (which occurred first in a linen shop, then, days later, in a nearby pub); the confused efforts of local "police" groups; and the cases' suspiciously abrupt closing after suspect John Williams, a seaman and lodger at the Pear Tree public house, committed suicide in jail, thereby sealing his "guilt" and prompting a bizarre parade of his corpse (together with a murderous maul) throughout the city. James and police historian Critchley use documents and contemporary news accounts splendidly, pointing up the incompetence of the investigators and offering an intriguing view of what really happened. First published in Britain in 1971, this will certainly please James's following here. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Secret of Hanging Rock: With Commentaries by John Taylor, Yvonne Rousseau and Mudrooroo</h2><p><p>Joan Lindsay's classic novel Picnic at Hanging Rock is a subtle blend of mysterious and sinister events set in a period of Australian social life drawn with loving nostalgia.

Having avoided the Alaskan challenge for years, Elsie and her husband Steve set out on the trusty <i>Osprey</i> on May 14, 2006, and spent the next three summers sailing, writing and photographing the towering fjords, immaculate glaciers, throwback fishing villages and overexposed tourist traps of America's largest state. They drifted past calving glaciers, watched bears feeding in green marshes, smelled the fresh cedar of newly carved totem poles and followed the path of gold prospectors on the White Pass and Yukon Route Railroad. Sometimes it was difficult to discern the real Alaska beneath the fa�ade, but Hulsizer finds it in many places, from the wild beauty of the ocean to the small coastal villages she visits and, sometimes, even where the tourists go. <i>Glaciers, Bears and Totems</i> is a rich book of adventure travel that is as valuable for its reading fun as for its travel information.</p><p>An Environmental professional with a degree in oceanography, <b>Elsie Hulsizer</b> lives in Seattle with her husband Steve.

He lives near Oxford, Mississippi.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Virgil followed the rain branch off the hill and drove to the Blizzard post office. The mail hadn't come yet and he continued past, giving a general wave to the crowd that gossiped in the glare of April sun. He drove up a steep hill to the county line. It was only two miles from the house he'd grown up in, but he'd never crossed it.<br><br>He parked by the edge of the cliff. The color of the air was brighter at the top. Clay Creek ran through the hollow with purple milkweed blooming in the ditch. When Virgil was a kid, he and his brother had walked its slippery bank, gathering enough empty pop bottles to buy candy when they reached Blizzard's only store. Virgil wished he and Boyd could do it again but people had stopped throwing pop bottles away when the deposit rose to a nickel. The store closed when the owner died. Boyd was dead now, too.<br><br>Virgil tried to imagine the land when it was flat across the hilltops, before a million years of rain chewed the dirt to make creeks and hollows. Clouds lay in heaps like sawdust piles. He figured he was seeing out of the county and he wondered if hawks could see farther, or just better. The world seemed smaller from above. The dips and folds of the wooded hills reminded him of a rumpled quilt that needed smoothing out.<br><br>Cars were leaving the post office, which meant the mail truck had arrived. A titmouse clung to a tree upside down, darting its head to pick an insect from a leaf. Pine sap ran like blood from a wound in the tree. Virgil drove down the road and parked in willow shade beside the creek. A tattered flag dangled above the post office, fastened permanently to a hickory pole. Every morning the postmaster, a white-haired man named Zephaniah, dragged the flagpole from the post office and slipped one end into a hole in the earth beside a fence post. He buckled a leather belt around the flagpole and the post. At day's end he stored the pole inside.<br><br>Instead of a system of organized boxes, Zephaniah had laid out a few narrow tables to correspond roughly with the surrounding terrain -- two hollows, a hill, and a creek. He arranged the day's mail in stacks that represented the location of each family's house in the community. Virgil leaned on the narrow shelf that protruded from the arched hole in the wall where Zephaniah worked. The shelf's edge was round and smooth from years of use.<br><br>"Flag's looking kindly ragged, ain't it," Virgil said.<br><br>"Government never sent a new one this year."<br><br>"Can't you tell them?"<br><br>"Could."<br><br>The screen door banged as a man from Red Bird Ridge came in.<br><br>"Mail run yet?" he said to Virgil.<br><br>"Just did."<br><br>"I ain't seen you since..."<br><br>The man adjusted his cap, looked at the floor, and rapidly scratched his sideburn. The last time they'd met had been at Boyd's funeral. Virgil didn't know how to ease the man's discomfort.<br><br>"Well, a long while went by since I seen you," the man said.<br><br>He stepped to the window and looked through the mail that Zephaniah had gathered for him.<br><br>"Write me a order, will you, Zeph?"<br><br>"How much?"<br><br>"Ten dollars even. Mamaw owes the doctors that much a month."<br><br>"Which doctor?"<br><br>"I don't know, that clinic in town. The one everybody goes to."<br><br>"Rocksalt Medical?"<br><br>"Reckon."<br><br>Zephaniah filled out the form, printing carefully. When he finished, he waited, and Virgil knew that Zephaniah would stand there all day rather than insult the man by asking him to write his name on the money order.<br><br>"Go ahead and sign it for me, Zeph."<br><br>Zephaniah wrote the man's name at the bottom of the money order, and asked for eleven dollars. The man placed three fives on the shelf.<br><br>"Buying money sure ain't cheap," he said.<br><br>"Best to have a checking account," Zephaniah said.<br><br>"None of my people have fooled with banks and I ain't about to start now."<br><br>"Need an envelope?"<br><br>The man nodded. Zephaniah wrote the address on a pre-stamped envelope and made change. The man went outside and spoke to Virgil through the screen. "Come here a minute."<br><br>Virgil went to the door. The man pressed his forehead to the screen, his skin pushing through the mesh in tiny squares. "I knowed your brother," he said. "You tell your mama I'm sorry."<br><br>Virgil never knew what to say back. The man looked up and down the creek before speaking in a ragged whisper. "It was a Rodale done it. Billy Rodale."<br><br>The man walked swiftly to his truck.<br><br>Virgil leaned against the wall and inhaled as deeply as possible. He let the air out in a long slow breath. Across the road, green tendrils of forsythia bushes dragged the creek.<br><br>"Virge?" said Zephaniah. "You all right?"<br><br>"Yeah. Just sick of it."<br><br>"Of what?"<br><br>"You know. Boyd and all."<br><br>"People feel bad."<br><br>"You didn't hear what he said."<br><br>"I heard. Ears is the last thing I got left that works."<br><br>"Well, I'm sick to death of it. I know who it was. The whole damn creek does, and I don't need everybody telling me. They figure I don't know since I ain't done nothing."<br><br>"A man like him ain't worth worrying about. He's the reason for the flag problem."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"I ain't asked for a new flag because I don't want to draw attention. When I retire, this post office will shut down. Only reason it's open now is folks buying money orders. Half this creek pays their bills through me. We're showing a profit here, which ain't exactly something the government is used to."<br><br>"So why close down?"<br><br>"Because profit ain't what they go by."<br><br>"What is?"<br><br>"If I knew that, I'd be President."<br><br>Fifty years ago the post office building had housed the company store for the town of Blizzard. The community had run on scrip issued by the mineral company. Now the mines were empty and the town was gone, along with its barbershop, saloon, train station, and doctor. Most of the families were gone, too. The remaining people still walked off the hillsides for money orders, another form of scrip.<br><br>"If they shut this down," Virgil said, "there won't be much left of here."<br><br>"Church and grade school," Zephaniah said. "I've throwed hours of thought at it. Blizzard's old and wore out, and the government's getting rid of it. They ain't too many to care about us. I'd say even God was right mad the day he laid this place out. It's as slanty a land as ever was."<br><br>"Maybe you could get a petition."<br><br>"Who'd sign it, Virge? You can't turn in a petition full of X's. They'd say if these people can't read or write, what do they need a post office for? No, Virge. Blizzard's done."<br><br>Zephaniah stood with his shoulders slumped, his arms hanging straight as if held by weights. He suddenly seemed what he was -- short and old.<br><br>"I could retire now," he said. "I'm tired enough, but I'm the last man with a job. That's why I keep working. If I stop, the town stops."<br><br>"Well."<br><br>"It burnt my daddy up that I never left out of here. He died still mad over it. I know they's some saying you ort to take care of that Rodale boy for killing Boyd. More say it than don't, my opinion. But I say get yourself out of here, and I don't mean Rocksalt, either. There's Mount Sterling to think on, even Lexington. No sense going to the state pen over your brother."<br><br>Virgil couldn't imagine leaving Blizzard. He'd lived here thirty-two years. Boyd was the restless one, the wild brother, the one who'd leave one day. Virgil had grown up letting Boyd do the talking and later the running around acting crazy. He drove fast, drank hard, played cards, and chased women. Finally, Boyd had done the dying.<br><br>The narrow hall seemed to squeeze Virgil and he felt a need for breath that he couldn't quite get. He was thirsty. He stumbled outside and smelled honeysuckle vine along the creek. He drove down the road and up the steep dirt lane of his home hill. In his mother's house, he turned on the faucet and let it run to bring water from deep in the earth. He drank two cups fast. His body recognized the water, its cold taste the most familiar sensation he'd ever known. He breathed through his nose as he drank, his chin and shirt wet.<br><br>He was drinking his fourth cup when he noticed his mother and sister watching from the doorway. He set the cup in the sink.<br><br>"Mom," he said, "I ain't going to that post office no more."<br><br>His mother's face didn't change, but the expression of her eyes did. Virgil recognized it as the look she got when Boyd said something outrageous, but she had never regarded Virgil in this manner. He leaned on the sink and looked through the window. It was cracked from the beak of a cardinal that had repeatedly attacked its own reflection.<br><br>"Where's the mail at anyway?" his sister said.<br><br>"I left it."<br><br>"Well, shoot, Virgie." Sara turned to their mother. "I'll send Marlon directly. I'm glad I married somebody who's got some sense, even if it's just to pick up the mail."<br><br>"I just don't like hearing that old gossip down there's all. You go, Sara. You'd talk a bird out of its nest."<br><br>"What were they saying?" Sara said.<br><br>Beside her, their mother waited without speaking. She had spent most of her life in just such a stance -- silent in the kitchen, waiting for news that was invariably bad.<br><br>"You don't really want to know, do you?" Virgil said.<br><br>Sara nodded.<br><br>"They say that Wayne girl is pregnant," he said.<br><br>"No!"<br><br>"Sure is."<br><br>"Which one?"<br><br>"Up on Redbird Ridge."<br>ard<br><br>"I know that," Sara said. "They ain't but one bunch of Waynes. I mean which girl?"<br><br>"The littlest."<br><br>"Lord love a duck, she ain't but fourteen."<br><br>"Well," Virgil said.<br><br>"Whose is it? Anybody say?"<br><br>"They's no question of that."<br><br>"Well, who?"<br><br>"I hate to be the one to tell you, Sara. But it was your Marlon done it."<br><br>Sara's face changed color. Her breath rasped into the air. Their mother glanced at her as if to make sure Sara wasn't going to collapse, then studied Virgil carefully.<br><br>"Sara, honey," she said. "I believe he's telling a story."<br><br>Sara grabbed a sponge and threw it, bouncing it off his chest and leaving a wet mark on his shirt.<br><br>"If you went for the mail," Virgil said, "you'd know true gossip from wrong."<br><br>"If you can't fetch mail," Sara said, "you at least can mow the yard."<br><br>Boyd had taken care of the yard and retrieved the mail. Four months after his death, the family was still trying to divvy up chores.<br><br>Copyright � 1997 by Chris Offutt</p><h2>From an Idea to Lego: The Building Bricks Behind the World&#39;s Largest Toy Company</h2><p><b>For fans of the successful Who Was series, From an Idea to&nbsp;Lego is a behind-the-bricks look into the world's famous toy company, with humorous&nbsp;black &amp; white illustrations throughout.</b><br><br>Today, LEGO is one of the biggest toy companies in the world, but a long time ago, a Danish carpenter, Ole Kirk Christiansen, started with just an idea.

Generally recognized as having introduced yoga and meditation to the West, he was the most popular and authoritative source of information on Eastern philosophies, gurus, and meditation systems from the mid-'30s to the '60s. His books have sold over two million copies in 17 languages.&nbsp;In 1954, he withdrew from public life and continued writing the material that was posthumously published as&nbsp;<i>The Notebooks of Paul Brunton</i>--a truly East-West spiritual philosophy. Written with the passion of an authentic pioneer and the thoughtfulness of a seasoned practitioner, his work is re-emerging as a beacon for all contemporary seekers.&#x201c;Paul Brunton ... has sought to throw a bridge across the chasm which separates yoga and pure ancient philosophy for searchers in the West.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Dallas Times-Herald</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;... goes to the very roots of the mysteries of yoga and the mysteries of modern materialistic sciences.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;New Book Digest&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;One has to acknowledge that many a student will be greatly indebted to Dr. Brunton for his assiduous work ... should be carefully read and studied by everyone interested in the subject.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The Seeker</i> [London]<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is the most mature of Paul Brunton's books and should reach a more deeply philosophic audience, as well as his previous circle of readers interested in the <i>Overself&nbsp;</i>... Brunton's function is to stimulate, to awaken consciousness of these problems in readers who would hesitate before the imponderables of Patanjali, Einstein, the sages of the East.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mr. Brunton is an able writer, commanding an extensive range of reading. He manages to be bold and modest at the same time ... his book is an introduction to critical thought, an approach to metaphysics.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Review of Religion</i> [USA]<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The book is crammed with telling yet sympathetic analyses of the shortcomings of the materialistic credo.

In both directions we reach out to Infinity. <br>Ernest Holmes <br>The Science of Mind <br>If you are reading this first chapter of this book, you have probably already asked the question, &#x201c;Why meditate?&#x201d; You might also have some ideas about why you want to explore meditation further. Maybe your friends have tried it and you&#x2019;ve seen some beneficial changes in them. Perhaps your doctor has suggested that you find ways to relieve stress. You may have heard something about it in a class or workshop and decided to get more information. This chapter lists different reasons why people begin meditating, as well as the short- and long-term results you can expect from it. <br>The most basic result of meditation is an altered state of consciousness. Actually, this result is not difficult to achieve, as your state of mind changes from moment to moment anyway. With meditation, however, there is a certain direction that the alteration is expected to take: muscles relax, emotional states become more calm, the mind rests, blood pressure decreases, pulse rate declines, the eyes focus in a different way, breathing slows, and an awareness of sounds in the immediate environment may increase. <br>If you meditate for an extended period of time, you may become aware of the shifting angle of the sun coming in a window. Your awareness may extend to other people in the room, or to sounds outside the building. Some people have said they can tune in to the movement of the planet itself by lying still on the ground and looking up at the night sky. <br>If your only meditation goal is relaxation, you will meet a challenge. Yes, your muscles relax, your emotions become quiet, and your heart rate slows. You can achieve measurable stress reduction in this way. On the other hand, the chatter in your mind becomes more and more apparent as you become quiet. Also, after an extended period of sitting in a meditative posture, your muscles begin to rebel. You develop twitches, muscles begin to cramp if the posture is unusual, and you fidget. What is meant to be relaxing becomes uncomfortable&#x2015;sometimes quite uncomfortable. <br>During extended meditation it is helpful to vary your technique. A period of sitting can be followed by a few minutes of walking to loosen up your muscles. You may think that ten minutes is a long time to sit still, and one minute of walking around is enough to flex and stretch. Often, people sit for forty-five to fifty minutes and walk for ten. <br>Meditation is not about how much time you put into it. Unless you live in a monastery or ashram, you probably don&#x2019;t have many hours each day to devote to meditation. However, you do have shorter periods of time available. The following are some examples: <br>�After you come home from school or work and have prepared supper, use the fifteen to twenty minutes while your food is baking in the oven. <br>�When you are on a plane or train or bus. <br>�When you are getting a haircut. <br>�When you are waiting for an appointment. <br>�When you are in the dentist&#x2019;s chair and waiting for the shot to take effect. (I know, this one will be a challenge for almost everybody!) <br>�When you are walking, running, or jogging. <br>�When you are painting, raking leaves, or doing other repetitive work. <br>By the same token, there are other times when your conscious attention needs to be given to what you are doing, and safety is an issue. Examples include: <br>�Driving a car <br>�Weightlifting <br>�Boiling or frying food <br>�Using any sharp implements <br>�Caring for children <br>�Crossing streets or roads <br>�Handling breakable objects <br>�Attending a lecture or performance <br>�Walking up or down stairs <br>�Moving furniture <br>These lists are not exhaustive, but they show that you can find meditative moments in your daily life. You don&#x2019;t have to set aside hours of time. If you can, that may be helpful. If not, find short bits of time and make use of them each day. Meditation will help you become more clear and focused when you are engaged in those other activities that demand your conscious attention. <br>Meditation Goals <br>If your meditation goals go beyond relaxation, then you will want to experiment a bit to find methods that help you to achieve those goals. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, relaxation is an admirable goal in our stressful modern lives. In fact, it is essential to physical and emotional health. Still, you may have other goals for your meditation. <br>Insight <br>Insight is a time-honored goal of meditation. Eastern adepts and Western monks and nuns have spent years in meditation or retreat in order to discover their connection to the universal plan. Your personal goals are just as important <br>to you. <br>I will relate a story told to me by an elderly Episcopal priest. He had been a priest all his adult life. During the Lenten season he had undertaken a forty-day retreat, something most of us will never do. He had devoted his life to understanding the nature of God and to helping others. In a conversation with me concerning how we demonstrate our love of God and what we feel we owe God, he said, &#x201c;You know, Stephanie, I have been a priest for over sixty-five years, and in these past weeks on retreat I have only now learned something about Him. God does not put us on Earth just so that we can love Him. He puts us here so that He can love us.&#x201d; This simple statement changed my life. Since that conversation I have often remembered this, and I have occasionally shared it with people who seemed to need reassurance that we each are part of a larger spiritual plan. <br>Now, we are not all priests or monks and we cannot all go on extended meditation retreats. What we can do is take the moments we have to calm our minds. Then we can perceive our place in the universal plan more clearly. You may connect through the Goddess, through multiple gods, through vibrational methods, through scientific investigation, or whatever means suits you. You can devote as much time as you wish to your meditation goals. Personally, I have found that more is not necessarily better, but some is necessary. The pace of my life could easily prevent me from having the time to write, for example. I can always find something else to do. Brief moments of quiet allow me to formulate and reorganize my thoughts. Then I can sit down and put the words together. <br>When you have a complex problem in the work environment, you need to get away from it to get a different perspective and to let the details sort themselves out in a way that points to a solution. Meditation provides one means of this. Sometimes a walk around the block is enough to accomplish this task. <br>Regarding the practice of meditation, Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche has written: <br>Many people expect the result of meditation to come in a short space of time, overnight, so to speak, but this is not possible. It is a process of development wherein consistency is the key. If we practice every day, regularly, even for a short period of time, that will add to our development.1 <br>Whatever your meditation goals, you can begin with just the simple act of sitting down and trying it. You don&#x2019;t need any fancy equipment or clothing and you need not revolutionize your daily schedule. Eventually you may want to find a teacher or attend workshops, but for now all you have to do is begin. <br>exercise <br>beginning to meditate <br>Read through the exercise, then close the book. <br>1. Sitting comfortably with your hands in your lap, or standing in a quiet spot, look at the cover of this book. <br>2. Relax your eyes and simply look. <br>3. Allow your attention to examine the details of the book&#x2019;s cover. <br>4. Continue doing this until you see something that catches your attention. <br>5. Then focus on why it caught your attention. Was it the color, the shape, the texture? <br>6. Refocus on the book&#x2019;s cover, and continue for a few moments. <br>7. Does something else arise to take your attention? <br>8. Notice any connections you make between the book&#x2019;s cover and your personal experience as you do this exercise. <br>Whatever arises for you is a bit of insight. It may not be the most profound insight you will ever experience, but it is insight. In the moments when we are not totally focused on the outer environment, or when we have a gap in our thought process, we allow insight to pop into our minds. You don&#x2019;t need a huge gap, just a relaxed state and attention to the meditation process. <br>summary <br>The simple act of altering your focus can place you in a slightly altered state of mind. In fact, we alter our states of mind every moment of our waking (and sleeping) life. We are constantly processing information, relating it to what we already know, and storing it for future use. Usually we are not conscious of the process, but we enter an altered state from moment to moment to moment. <br>The next chapter introduces a few meditation postures and other meditation tips. <br> <br></p><h2>The Helianx Proposition: The Return of the Rainbow Serpent&#x2015;A Cosmic Creation Fable (Gift Edition)</h2><p><i>The Helianx Proposition</i>, a bardic literary work with exquisite fine-art illustration, is a modern-day creation myth that explores the deeper symbolic meaning of the legend of the Garden of Eden.

As he tells their stories, Fromkin, author of <b>A Peace to End All Peace</b>, shows how this generation not only made America great but largely succeeded in making it a force for good.</p><p>David Fromkin is University Professor and Professor of History at Boston University. He is the author of <b>In the Time of the Americans</b>, a History Book Club selection, and the national best-seller <b>A Peace to End All Peace</b>, which was a finalist for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize and was singled out by the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> as one of the thirteen &#x201c;Best Books of the Year&#x201d; in 1989. He lives in New York City.Fromkin's best-selling <i>A Peace to End All Peace</i> (1989) described "the final achievement of European imperialism" in the Middle East. This new study focuses on a "coherent generation" --the subtitle's presidents and generals, plus some U.S. politicians, statesmen, and journalists--that "defined America's role in the international politics of the twentieth century." It is a well-written and entertaining study, but profoundly conventional history. It takes Fromkin pages to note that the turn-of-the-century Americans he describes as innocent, pacifist, isolationist, and anti-imperialist did "bellicose" things to "Indians and others" who stood in their way. Five pages after he points out that Haym Solomon (an ancestor of William C. Bullitt) helped to finance the American Revolution, Fromkin describes the U.S. as "entirely Christian" until 1890. And his "generation" is, of course, composed entirely of white men. Readers who idolize this generation of U.S. internationalists--as so many of <i>them</i> venerated TR and Woodrow Wilson--will certainly want to read this book, but librarians will want to remember that Fromkin tells only part of the story. <i>Mary Carroll</i></p><h2>I See You Everywhere</h2><p><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER</b><br><b><br>A <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> Best Book of the Year</b><br><br>Julia Glass, the bestselling, National Book Award-winning author of <b>Three Junes</b>, returns with a tender, riveting book of two sisters and their complicated relationship. <br><br>Louisa Jardine is the older one, the conscientious student, precise and careful: the one who yearns for a good marriage, an artistic career, a family.

In this vivid, heartrending story of what we can and cannot do for those we love, the sisters grow closer as they move further apart.

I&#x2019;m not a rebel, a recluse, or a sociopath, and I&#x2019;m too young to qualify as a crank, even if it&#x2019;s true that I just spent the evening of my twenty-fifth birthday not carousing with friends or drinking champagne at a candlelit table for two but resolutely alone and working, glazing a large ovoid porcelain bowl while listening to Ella Fitzgerald sing songs by the Gershwin brothers. (A crank could never love Gershwin.) My one real boyfriend in college, just before we broke up, told me I&#x2019;m nostalgic to a fault. He professed contempt for what he called &#x201c;the delusional sound track to our parents&#x2019; deluded lives.&#x201d; He informed me that you can&#x2019;t be nostalgic for things that had their heyday before you were so much as born. Just about any member of my family would have laughed him out the door and down the garden path.Family reunions are the worst&#x2014;all that competition disguised as fellowship&#x2014;and they&#x2019;re also the hardest to avoid. But when my father&#x2019;s Great-Aunt Lucy died last summer, there was an inheritance at stake, a collection of antique jewelry. Not the glossy priceless stuff&#x2014;no diamonds, tiaras, or niagaras of pearls. Not things you&#x2019;d sell but things so deliciously old-fashioned and stylish that to wear them makes you feel like a character from a Jane Austen novel or a Chekhov play. The one piece I remembered most vividly was a cameo, two inches square, ivory on steel-blue Pacific coral, a woman&#x2019;s face inclined toward her hand, in her slender fingers an iris. Aunt Lucy had worn that cameo day and night, winter and summer, on lace and wool. Maybe she&#x2019;d left us a charm bracelet, maybe earrings of garnet or Mexican silver, but mostly I wondered about that cameo. And wanted it. I&#x2019;d wanted it since I was a little girl. One of my earliest memories is of sitting on Lucy&#x2019;s lap, squirming to find a comfortable spot on her bony thighs yet happy to feel her kind honeyed voice in my hair as she talked with the other grown-ups gathered on her porch. She did not object to my poking and fingering the cameo, probing its fragile details: the woman&#x2019;s eyelids and earlobes, the cuticles of her nails, the harmoniously wandering tendrils of her hair. She let me borrow it once, for a family dinner at a country inn.Because Lucy never had children, not even a husband, my father long ago became the one who kept an eye on her in the last decades of her very long life. Geographically, he was the closest family member by far; out of a large, tenaciously Confederate clan, they were the only two living anywhere you can count on snow. Once Dad decided to stay north, after earning two degrees at Harvard, the family lumped him together with Lucy: &#x201c;How are the defectas faring up yonda?&#x201d; a cousin might ask Dad at a wedding in Memphis or Charleston. Happily, their proximity blossomed into genuine affection.So Dad was the executor of Lucy&#x2019;s will, which emerged from her bureau drawer along with a letter to my father that she&#x2019;d written a year before she died. <i>It began, To my splendid grandnephew Beauchance: Before I take my irreversible leave (which I suppose I will now have taken, strange to think), I am seizing this lucid moment to write down a few matters pertaining to the house and my ragbag possessions therein. I have little doubt that I shall have left the house in a rather sorry state, for which I apologize. Be charitable, if you can, to any bats or raccoons which may have colonized the attic or basement (though none to my knowledge have done so), and please take Sonny&#x2019;s word on any tasks for which he claims I still owe him payment; our mutual accounting has grown slack if not capricious. . . .</i>Over the phone, Dad read me the letter in its crisp yet meandering entirety, stopping now and then to chuckle. I heard no tears in his voice until the end, where she wrote, <i>Whatever modest adornments pass for jewelry, I leave to your daughters, Louisa and Clement. I did not become as intimately acquainted with them as I would have liked, but I did know the satisfaction, one summer to the next, of seeing how they grew; as I wish I had seen you evolve in your youth. I wish I had known much sooner, Beau, that you would become the facsimile of a perfect son, a gift whose pleasures I wish I had been blessed to know firsthand.</i>His voice cracked on the word <i>gift</i>, as if he didn&#x2019;t deserve such gratitude, my father who will do just about anything for anyone, driving my mother crazy with all the favors he does for everyone else (including, as she likes to say, any random citizen of Outer Slobovia and its most godforsaken suburbs).I decided to fly across the entire country because I couldn&#x2019;t bear the thought that if I didn&#x2019;t show up in person, my sister might inherit everything&#x2014;including that cameo&#x2014;by default. On the plane, I tried to decide which of two equally vulgar motives, materialism or spite, had compelled me to buy a ticket I couldn&#x2019;t afford to a place where I&#x2019;d see no one I wanted to see. My life was not, as people like to say, in a good place&#x2014;though, ironically, the place where I lived at the time happened to be Santa Barbara. So I made excuses and timed my visit to avoid the masses of cousins, aunts, and uncles who would descend on Lucy&#x2019;s house to grope the heirlooms by day and drink too much bourbon by night. I may share their Huguenot blood, but not their bad taste in booze and their glutinous drawl. I will never forget how, when our grandmother died two years ago, the family marauded her New Orleans house with no more respect than the Union soldiers who stripped us all bare a century back. You&#x2019;d think, with all our costly educations, the reconstructed Jardines would avoid civil wars. Well, ha. There was an ugly brawl, which featured weeping and a smashed lamp, over the Steinway grand. Someone with Solomonic intentions actually went so far as to crank up a chainsaw. I could not deal with that type of gathering all over again. Whether I could deal with Clem remained to be seen.My sister had been living with Aunt Lucy for what proved to be her final summer. After Lucy&#x2019;s death, Clem stayed on while the relatives passed through, finishing up her summer jobs before heading back to college for her junior year. During the days, Clem worked in a bike shop and volunteered at a sanctuary for recovering raptors: birds, she&#x2019;d explained when I called, that had been shot, struck by small planes, tortured by teenage boys. In the evenings, she kept an eye on Lucy&#x2014;until her sudden death at the beginning of August. Not that our aunt was infirm, incontinent, or witless, but for the last several months of her life she was afflicted with an obstinate restlessness that sent her out after dark on urgent eccentric missions. Winooski, Vermont, is a snug, friendly place, so she wasn&#x2019;t likely to be mugged or abducted. Nevertheless, reasoned Dad, who could say she wouldn&#x2019;t do something drastic like sell her last shares of Monsanto and Kodak, head for the airport, and unintentionally vanish?I&#x2019;d hardly spoken to Clem since moving out west two years before. After college, in pursuit of a man I&#x2019;d prefer to jettison from memory, I hauled my pottery wheel, my heart, and my disastrously poor judgment from Providence to California. It was completely unlike me to do anything so rash; maybe, subconsciously, I was trying to get back at Clem by pretending to <i>be</i> Clem, to annoy her by stealing her role as devil-may-care adventuress. Whatever the reason for my tempestuous act, it backfired. Three weeks after I signed a lease and bought a secondhand kiln, the boyfriend shed me like a stifling, scratchy-collared coat. To keep up with the rent I&#x2019;d fooled myself into thinking he would share, I gave up my car. After that, I sold a pitcher here, a platter there, but to stave off eviction I wrote articles for a magazine that told workaholic doctors what to do with their leisure time. In college, I&#x2019;d been just as good with words as I was with clay, and one of my Brit-lit classmates had started this odd publication. People had laughed, but subscriptions to<i> Doc&#x2019;s Holiday</i> sold like deodorant soap.Thus did I hold starvation at bay, but I also felt like the work kept me stuck in a place where I ought to love living but didn&#x2019;t. Everything out there unnerved me: the punk shadows of palm trees slashing the lawns, the sun setting&#x2014;not rising&#x2014;over the ocean, the solitude of the sidewalks as I rushed everywhere on foot, carless and stared at. My inner compass refused to budge.<i> North!</i> it kept urging me.<i> East! </i>I&#x2019;d just come to the conclusion that I didn&#x2019;t belong there and never would, and I was feeling uncomfortable in my work, both kinds, but I had no intention of letting Clem in on my angst. My plan was never to trust her again, never to fall for her charms the way everyone else, especially men, seemed to do so fervently. And to snare that cameo. Maybe a string of pearls. Oh, Glenn Miller. I love him, too. What&#x2019;s life without a little delusion?�If you&#x2019;re to hear Louisa&#x2019;s version of what went on last summer, you will also be hearing mine. Louisa&#x2019;s worst side is the one I call the Judge. � la Salem witchcraft trials. There&#x2019;s this look she gets on her face that tells the world and everyone in it how completely unworthy it and they are to contain or witness her presence. <i>Beware!</i> says that look. <i>The Spanish Inquisition was Entenmann&#x2019;s Danish!</i>Her new life in Santa Ladeedabra did not seem to have mellowed her out one iota, because when I pulled up at the airport, that&#x2019;s the look she was wearing, firm as a church hat, beaming her world-weary scorn clear across the state of Vermont. I was late, okay, which didn&#x2019;t help. It didn&#x2019;t help either, I know, that it was me picking her up.I wonder sometimes what kind of sisters we&#x2019;ll be when we&#x2019;re ancient (if we ever are). Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine: before that visit, you&#x2019;d have bet the hacienda we&#x2019;d end up like them. Cold? Suspicious? Resentful? Ever notice how sisters, when they aren&#x2019;t best friends, make particularly vicious enemies? Like, they could be enemies from the time they lay their beady little eyes on each other, maybe because their mother makes them rivals or maybe because there&#x2019;s not enough love to go around and&#x2014;not out of greed but from the gut, like two hawks zeroing in on a wren&#x2014;they have no choice but to race for it. (Laws of nature, pure and simple. Be vigilant and survive. Altruism? A myth. Share? Oh please. Whatever it is that feeds the hunger, dive-bomb first, philosophize later.) Or maybe they grow apart in a more conscious way, maybe because their marriages clash: the guys they choose see each other as losers or sellouts; the women are helplessly loyal. But that&#x2019;s not our story. No husbands yet, not even a hint of husband.I&#x2019;ve always been the favorite&#x2014;our mother&#x2019;s, at least. Partly, it&#x2019;s the animal thing: Mom grew up on a storybook farm where animals ruled life more strictly than clocks. And I happen to be the one who set my sights that way. Saving animals is all I&#x2019;ve ever wanted to do. In fourth grade, I asked Mom to give me all her shoe boxes. A hospital: that was the plan. I cut windows in the ends of the boxes and stacked them in the bottom of my closet like high-rise condos. My first baby bird got the penthouse. Next day, he was dead. They almost always die, I&#x2019;d learn. But that didn&#x2019;t stop me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my daughter, all right,&#x201d; said Mom when she saw what I&#x2019;d built (though her tone made me wonder if the likeness was such a good thing).Louisa thinks this makes my life easy&#x2014;being the favorite. She doesn&#x2019;t realize that once you&#x2019;re the disappointment, or once you&#x2019;ve chosen a path seen as odd or unchoosable, your struggle is over, right? On the other side of the fence&#x2014;mine&#x2014;every expectation you fulfill (or look like you might, on purpose or not) puts you one step higher and closer to that Grand Canyon rim from which you could one day rule the world&#x2014;or plummet in very grand style.�In the car, I let Clem do the talking. She was late to pick me up, and I was glad: it gave me a reason to sulk until I could get my bearings. I was glad to be back in New England, but I was cross-eyed with fatigue. I cannot sleep on planes. So Clem filled me in on the reading of the will and what she called the Great Divide: relatives clutching lists, drawing lots, swarming the house like fire ants. But this time there were no dogfights; everyone, said Clem, remembered the piano brawl.I hadn&#x2019;t seen the place in five years, and when we arrived, I just stood on the walk and stared. It&#x2019;s a Victorian, more aspiring than grand, and it had always looked a little anemic, but now it was a wreck. The sallow paint, formerly white, hung off the clapboards in broad curling tongues, and the blue porch ceiling bore the crusty look of a cave complete with stalactites. The flagstones were fringed with moss. The front steps sagged. That the lawn had just been mowed made the house look even more derelict. &#x201c;How could Dad let her live this way?&#x201d; I asked.</p><h2>Out of Darkness into the Light: A Journey of Inner Healing</h2><p><b>A compelling account of the journey&nbsp;from severe depression, guilt, and near alcoholism to&nbsp;a true healing of the mind and spirit&#x2014;from a&nbsp;bestselling author and noted psychiatrist</b><br><br><i>"If there is hope for one like me, who thought that he was beyond all help, and who believed he had more guilt, more shame, and a greater feeling of inadequacy than anyone else in the world, then rest assured that there is hope for you."</i><br><br>Millions of men and women have had their lives transformed by Dr. Gerald Jampolsky's pioneering work in the field of attitudinal healing and by his bestsellers <i>Love Is Letting Go of Fear, Goodbye to Guilt,</i>&nbsp;and <i>Teach Only Love</i>.

Caught up in my fragmented and sometimes chaotic life, I often did not find the time to look at these concepts with any depth and clarity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Regardless of how it looked to the outside world, I never felt that my goals were consistent. I think I share a common experience with a great many people, a feeling of being lost but not wanting to admit it to myself or to others. So many of us feel that we are like the proverbial little lambs who have lost their way. We feel like strangers in the world, never quite sure where to find our real homes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> To start a journey, we need to be certain of our identities, to know who and what we are. Before I found a path of spiritual guidance, I felt that my entire identity consisted of my ego, the person in this body named Jerry Jampolsky I felt that I was the sum total of what I did in life and there really wasn&#x2019;t any more to life than that. Being a physician was part of my identity. Another part was my belief that my body was here for only a limited time. Sooner or later I would die, and that would be the end of my life and the end of my identity. Because there were so many people around me who shared that belief, I never saw any reason to question it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Over the years it has been pointed out to me that we limit ourselves and others when we create labels for one another, categorizing ourselves by the work we do. In the past, after being with a person less than two minutes, I would ask, &#x201c;What do you do?&#x201d; When they answered &#x201c;doctor,&#x201d; &#x201c;bus driver,&#x201d; &#x201c;teacher,&#x201d; etc., I would judge their value and determine whether I wished to spend more time with them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The possibility that our true identities could be found in our spiritual beings, or that what we are is love, and that our true reality might have nothing to do with our vocations, bodies, or egos, had previously seemed both preposterous and illogical to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1974 I had an experience that taught me that there might be another way to relate to others and to myself. I was at a cocktail party. Not in the mood for small talk, I saw an empty couch and headed toward it. Just as I sat down, another man took a seat beside me.<br> &nbsp;<br> We immediately struck up a conversation and had a wonderful time. We talked from our hearts about many things, and we spoke in depth, lime seemed to fly. Later, our hostess joined us. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you two met,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can see from your animated conversation how much you enjoy each other.&#x201d; We agreed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man and I had never introduced ourselves. It turned out that he was a world-renowned concert pianist. When our hostess told him I was a psychiatrist, he laughed and said, &#x201c;I hate psychiatrists. If you had introduced yourself as one, I probably would have walked away.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I laughed. Then it was my turn to confess: &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d known you were a famous musician, I would have felt so inadequate and threatened I couldn&#x2019;t have talked to you, either.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps our identities have more to do with our hearts than with what we do with our bodies in our day-to-day lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early Roadmaps<br> &nbsp;<br> We learn and accept much about our identities through our parents, of course. However, a great part of our identities is focused on the creation of the ego&#x2019;s road-map for life. By looking back at my earliest experiences, I find that I become better acquainted with my ego and begin to recognize its voice in my present life. I then start seeing my ego a little more clearly and can recognize its voice of fear and separation when it shouts at me.<br> &nbsp;<br> One very loud part of its voice is in my parents&#x2019; philosophy that yesterday was awful, today is horrendous, and tomorrow will be even worse, so one must be on guard at all times. Listening to the voice of that belief system led me to depression and hopelessness. I learned a lot about this part of my roadmap from my mother, who was a very protective person.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes I would get split messages from my parents. For example, on one Sunday drive we came to a very steep hill that my mother said was too dangerous to drive up. She had my father stop at the bottom so that she could get out and walk up the hill; she got back into the car at the top. It did not occur to me until years later that in spite of how dangerous it was in her mind, my mother had allowed the rest of us to drive up that hill.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another thing I remember is that my parents were always telling me to hurry. It didn&#x2019;t matter what I was doing&#x2014;getting dressed, taking a bath, eating, going off to school&#x2014;I was never fast enough. I especially remember dinners with my family. With five of us at the table, everything was done in a great rush. Dishes were passed quickly, food was scooped out in a flash, and we all ate as fast as we could. It was partly from this experience that I integrated the &#x201c;hurry concept&#x201d; into the other aspects of my roadmap. I ran through each day at full speed, never quite sure if I was running away from something or toward it, and never certain why I was in such a hurry. My ego drove me to rush, although it seldom came up with any good reasons for doing so.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a child I was always fidgeting, always in motion-in today&#x2019;s terms, I would have been labeled hyperkinetic or hyperactive&#x2014;and if there was a choice of directions to take, I invariably chose the wrong one. Looking back, I have the impression that I was always spilling milk and bumping into things. From all this I picked up another aspect of my roadmap&#x2014;an impression of myself as a clumsy clod, which my ego-self was only too willing to adopt.<br> &nbsp;<br> I always left a big dust storm behind me and must have driven my poor parents to distraction. I never walked if I could run, and I continued to bump into things and lose my way. My frenetic energy was very difficult for most people around me.<br> &nbsp;In this quasi-spiritual autobiography, Jampolsky shares childhood memories and his experiences in medical school, residency, and successful psychiatric practice--all undertaken with a determination to succeed despite his being overshadowed by fear and guilt. During the crisis following the dissolution of his marriage, his life was dramatically changed by a chance exposure to the esoteric New Age teaching know as "A Course in Miracles." He records a key turning point: "It was a monumental test for me; I had to choose whether to listen to the voice of my rational mind, . . . or to listen to that quiet, calm voice in my heart." Later he founded the Center for Attitudinal Healing. A blueprint for others hoping to find the light in which he basks, this book will appeal primarily to those already persuaded by the "California-style" inspirational approach.<br><i>- Carol R.

With his hand considerably strengthened by his election as Dictator by the Senate in Rome, Caesar knew that power would only be a reality once he had militarily defeated Pompey. By August 49BC, Caesar had effectively destroyed Pompey's armies in Spain, but, by the time he had crossed the Adriatic pursuing him eastward, his forces were heavily outnumbered. Even with the reinforcements brought by Mark Antony, his attempt to crush Pompey by laying siege to Dyrrachium was unsuccessful and he eventually had to withdrew into Thessaly, with Pompey in pursuit.</p><p>The stage was set for the final clash of the two titans of the Roman world and the odds were heavily in Pompey's favour, with 45,000 men against Caesar's 22,000. However, the veteran legions loyal to Caesar were the best in the Roman army and the challenge he faced clearly stimulated Caesar's tactical genius for battle. Guessing that Pompey would attempt to overwhelm his right wing with his cavalry, he concealed elite cohorts of legionnaries behind his own heavily outnumbered horsemen with orders to fight at close quarters like pikemen. Caesar's predictions were correct and, far from overwhelming his exposed right flank, Pompey's left flank was routed, allowing Caesar to envelop and scatter the rest of his army.</p><p>Simon Sheppard expertly charts the events leading up to the Pharsalus campaign, the course of the battle itself and the seismic implications of this decisive clash between the two greatest generals of their age.</p></p><p>Simon Sheppard is a graduate student of Political Science at John Hopkins University.

Unveiling Your Hidden Powers will make Emma Curtis Hopkins accessible to thousands of new readers, and will also equip them to apply Truth principles in a practical way on behalf of themselves as well as others.</p><p>Putting together U<i>nveiling Your Hidden Power</i>&nbsp;was a labor of love that took several years and many drafts. It began when I was called out of town for several months and the groups I was leading through Emma's <i>Scientific Christian Mental Practice</i>&nbsp;wanted to continue meeting but weren't able to interpret her prose or understand her many references to early Greek, Christian, and Roman writers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they scanned the chapters and I sent them sheets with Emma's text on one side and my explanations on the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for me to realize it would be easier to just tell them what she said in language they could understand!&nbsp;&nbsp;But it also became clear that this book was not a carefully constructed text, but rather a transcription of her class lectures. There are significant holes in the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I went to the other two books of hers I could find: <i>High Mysticism</i>&nbsp;and <i>Resume. </i>There I found, not only the missing pieces, but also references that, when put together with what is in <i>SCMP, </i>become a clear set of guidelines for a daily practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of putting these all together and "translating" Emma's Victorian prose into more modern usage was transformative. Writing and formatting the text was doing the practice. Clarifying her ideas was training my own mind. Seeing the links between the different sacred scriptures on which she built her work was a wonderful confirmation of my own Interfaith tendencies and appreciation for what Alduous Huxley called "The Perennial Philosophy."&nbsp;&nbsp;For several years I shared a comb-bound version of the book with Seminary students and informal study groups, and each time new copies were needed, I'd refine it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a friend said she'd like to publish it--so <i>Unveiling Your Hidden Power</i>&nbsp;was released to the world.&nbsp;Ruth L.

Indeed, honest facing up to the contradiction between our common faith in the "one church" and the divided state of Christianity is a prime motive for the ecumenical movement. <p>It is true, of course, that the mere fact that Christians use the same words in professing their faith about the church does not eliminate their deep differences in ecclesiology. Profoundly divergent answers will be given when one asks: What do you mean when you say "the church"? and How do you understand it to be one, holy, catholic and apostolic? Ecumenical progress, then, calls for the effort to reach a common under- standing of the faith we profess. Theology has an important role to play here, because theology is defined as "faith seeking understanding." Ecumenical dialogue is most fruitful when it is a concerted effort, on the part of people coming from different theological traditions, to seek a deeper understanding of the creed in which they already profess a common faith, in the hopes that such a deeper understanding will get beneath their differences to the common ground where they are at one. </p><p>An essential step in this process is for Christians to seek to deepen and clarify their understanding of their faith to the light of their own respective traditions. Such is the purpose of this book. What we are seeking here is an understanding of our profession of faith concerning the church, in the light of the Roman Catholic tradition.</p></p><p></p><h2>Wallpaper* City Guide Copenhagen</h2><p><p><b>The fast-track guide for the design-conscious traveller</b></p><p><em>Wallpaper* City Guides</em> present a tightly edited, discreetly packaged list of the best a location has to offer the design conscious traveller.

A shadowy plague in human form swarmed over the glittering, rocky landscape, tainting it by merely existing. He concentrated, allowing the crystalline chamber to show him more. A myriad collection of images related to his request filled the walls. He saw the three great ships, black as pitch, anchored off the shore and wondered how they could have come so far without him noting them. It was a troubling sign, an indication that he had slept deeper than he had desired.<br> <br>Rather than contemplate it further, he studied the other reflections. One facet revealed a detailed image of some of the invaders and this he brought to the forefront. He hissed. They were familiar to him although the name by which they went did not come to him at first. In contrast to the sun-drenched region they now occupied, the figures wore armor the color of night, armor unadorned save for the helm. Atop each, a crest fashioned into the snarling visage of a wolf&#x2019;s head leered down, a reflection in many ways of the men themselves. In the distance he could see the banners fluttering in the wind. The profile of the same wolf, surrounded by a field of deep crimson, watched over the army, for that was what it was.<br> <br>The name came to him at last.

He knew, though, that falling prey to such a tempting choice was to invite the downfall of all that was his. Despite the danger to his mind . . . to his very being . . . he had to stay awake. The wolf raiders were familiar enough to him that he knew they could not be left unattended.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aaaah . . .&#x201d; There they were. The officers.

In addition to the cloak, the Pack Leader would have a more elaborate helm and a single badge with the mark of the wolf upon it, but that was all. The Aramites cared little for insignias of rank otherwise. An officer was an officer, whatever his level, and that was all that mattered. Officers were meant to be obeyed in all things. Blind obedience was part of the wolf raider creed.<br> <br>His first glance at them revealed nothing of significance and he was almost tempted to seek another reflection when the scene as a whole suddenly registered. The wolf raiders had a <i>prisoner.</i> He could not see who or what it was at first, for the ebony-garbed soldiers surrounded the hapless soul, as if fascinated by what they had captured. They poked at the unfortunate with short swords and talked among themselves.<br> <br>There was one among them who did not laugh, but rather stood to the side, his round, young face a mask of boredom. He might have seemed entirely indifferent to the world around him if not for the hunger visible in his eyes. They darted back and forth, drinking in everything yet never resting on any object for more than a few moments. Interested despite himself, the watcher sought a reflection giving him a closer view of this one raider.<br> <br>He was smaller of stature and unassuming at first glance, but there was that about him that made one wary. When the eyes of the young Aramite suddenly turned in his direction, the intensity with which they stared was so unsettling that the watcher almost thought he had been discovered. Then, the wolf raider returned his own attention to the captive, breaking the spell.<br> <br>Chagrined, the master of the crystalline chamber followed the Aramite&#x2019;s gaze and, for the first time, beheld the wolf raiders&#x2019; captive.<br> <br>It was a Quel. Even bound and on his knees, he was nearly as tall as the humans. Gray netting enshrouded him from the top of his armored head to the ground, but enough was visible. The watcher marveled that any rope could hold the creature, especially a male as huge as this one. The Quel&#x2019;s long, tapering snout had also been bound, either to put an end to his hooting or to prevent him from snapping off the fingers of any raider foolish enough to reach too close. The raiders had also been clever enough to pull their prisoner&#x2019;s thick arms back so that the Quel could not make proper use of his lengthy claws. Designed to dig through the harsh soil of this land, the claws of the underground dweller would easily pass through the armor and flesh of an Aramite soldier without pause. Likely, the wolf raiders had already learned that fact the hard way, for it was doubtful that the capture had been an easy task. Even <i>he</i> respected the incredible strength behind those rending hooks.<br> <br><i>Why a Quel?</i> He pondered that. Had the Quel attacked the camp? Had they somehow simply caught this one unaware as he had surfaced? The latter seemed unlikely, considering how well the subterranean creatures knew this region, for they had been here longer than even he. It <i>was</i> possible that the raiders merely thought their prisoner a beast of some sort and not of a race older than their own. Humans could be presumptuous when it came to their place in the scheme of things.<br> <br>He had no care himself for the fate of the Quel. The race stayed clear of his domain, despite the fact that it had meant abandoning what had once been a part of their mighty, subterranean city. To a Quel, nothing short of death would make one of them invade his realm. They feared not only him, but the power he controlled.<br> <br><i>The power he controlled</i> . . . For a moment the watcher forgot his own task and laughed silently at himself. If he controlled the power, then it controlled him just as much. Likely more. He could never be free of it, for to be free would be to lose himself forever.<br> <br>His mind began to drift and the chamber, responding to his every thought, conscious or otherwise, allowed the multitude of images to fade, almost immediately to be replaced by one and one alone copied over and over in the facets of the crystalline walls. It was a single, rough-hewed face partly obscured by a helm and a beard, a face in many ways too akin to the visages of the wolf raiders. A warrior, a soldier obsessively obedient in character no matter what the cause.<br> <br>It was too much. Roaring, he rose from his resting place and waved a huge, taloned hand at the array of faces. The images vanished as swiftly as they had materialized. In their place returned the encampment of the invaders. Slowly, the fear and anger dwindled, albeit not completely. Once more, the Quel and his captors took the stage. They were almost welcome now, for anything was better than lingering too much on a past so long dead it no longer seemed anything more than another dream.<br> <br>When he gazed at the walls this time, however, he saw that all was <i>not</i> yet well. Something, in fact, was terribly wrong. The reflections wavered, twisted, making it seem as if the world beyond the chamber had become fluid. At first, he thought it was his own raging mind, but that was not the case. He had lived with the chamber for so long that he knew its ways, knew both its limitations and idiosyncrasies as well as he knew himself. Possibly better.<br> <br>Whatever the cause, it came from without and he could not doubt that somehow its roots led back to those who had dared to think they could make his dominion into theirs.<br> <br>Reaching out with his thoughts, he used the power of the chamber to seek out the source. The pictures wavered further and many of them altered as he narrowed his focus. The cause was near where the Quel was being held, but try as he might, it was impossible to focus exactly on the location he wanted. That, too, was peculiar; nothing ever long escaped the chamber&#x2019;s intrusive ability.<br> <br>Briefly, the milky vision of a tent surfaced in several of the facets of the glittering walls. Peering closer, the watcher struggled to strengthen the images. He was rewarded with new visions, just as murky as the first, of an armored man seated in the tent. There was a glimpse of a beast of some sort wrapped around his shoulders and another picture that indicated a second figure standing behind the first. Of the second all that could be said was that he was as tall as the young raider guarding the Quel had been short and his skin appeared to be, of all things, a vivid blue.<br> <br><i>More! I must know more!</i> Few times had the chamber, his sanctum, failed him so. That it did now only made the need to discover the truth even more essential to him. If the wolf raiders were the cause of this, then they were truly a threat to the fragile balance he had maintained for so long.<br> <br>His talons scraped at the floor, gouging the already ravaged surface. His breathing grew rapid. It was a strain to have to concentrate so, especially without sufficient rest. Now more than ever, there was danger that he might lose himself, become as the others before him had become . . .<br> <br>Almost he had the image, a thing held in one hand of the seated Aramite, likely the Pack Leader he had sought earlier. In his eagerness to see it, however, he allowed his control to slip ever so slightly. The vision wavered again . . . then became a meaningless blur.<br> <br>&#x201c;Curssssse you, you malevolent mirror!&#x201d; he roared, forgetting himself and the danger such rages represented to him.<br> <br>Flame licked the multiple images of the wolf raider camp as his frustration became action. His tail lashed out and struck the opposing wall, where more than a dozen identical Quel gazed up into the dark eyes of more than a dozen identical young officers, each of whom had removed a foot-long rod from his belt. A second burst of flame momentarily scorched the reflections of a score of soldiers searching among the crystal-encrusted rock, their purpose in doing so a mystery that, for the time, held no interest to the maddened watcher.<br> <br>As his eyes reddened in fury and he prepared to lash out again, the wolf raiders once more faded away. For a single breath, the chamber of crystal turned opaque. Then, the dull gray walls gave way to a new reflection. The flame within him died an abrupt death. He stared, paralyzed, at the legion of maddened, reptilian visages. They, in turn, stared back, a gleaming array of monstrous heads all bearing the same expression of disbelief and horror that he did. The toothy maws were open wide and from each a forked tongue flickered in and out. Eyes narrow and inhuman burned into his head. Gemlike skin rippled with each harsh, halting breath. Leathery wings unfurled and furled.<br> <br>He recoiled from the condemning images, but there was no escaping the fact that each and every reflection was of him.<br> <br><i>Yessss . . . I am the masssster of the Legar Peninssssula, am I not? I am the monster men call the Crysssstal Dragon</i> . . . He faced the reflections again, this time in defiance. <i>But I am also myself and I shall always be!</i><br> <br>Despite his defiant stance, however, he knew he had come much too close to succumbing, closer than he had in centuries. The past few years were much to blame. Nearly two decades before, he had been forced to spend himself rescuing the Dragonrealm from his fatalistic counterpart to the north, the unlamented Ice Dragon. Reversing the spell of chilling death that the mad drake had unleashed had taken too much. The rage had almost overtaken him then. He had not come as close as now to being lost, but he had come close.<br> <br>The wolf raiders would not leave of their own will. Like the parasites they were, they would remain until they had either been eradicated or had wrung from the land all that they could. If they did not know of the Quel&#x2019;s legacy yet, the Crystal Dragon had no doubt that they would before long . . . and that legacy would also lead them to him. The monarch of the Legar Peninsula understood all too well that even his presence would not deter men such as these. Their tenacity was almost reminiscent of another time, another people.<br> <br><i>And so, in the end, I must fight . . . even should it mean a victory in which all I desire to save is lost!</i> He tried to erase the repellent notion from his mind, but it had already embedded itself firmly within. There would be no escaping it. It would haunt him awake and asleep. Finally surrendering to that inevitable fact, the Dragon King settled down. Sleep, which he needed, was no longer really even an option for him. He could rest, but he could not afford the luxury of deep, enshrouding oblivion. The blight upon his realm had to be removed before it spread beyond his ability to control.<br> <br>The Crystal Dragon shuddered at the thought of what he would be forced to do if that happened. There would be only <i>one</i> choice left to him then . . . and it might leave behind a legacy compared to which the devastation attempted by the Ice Dragon would seem a <i>blessing.</i><br> <br>Still, to <i>him</i> it would be worth the cost.<br> <b>II</b><p></p> <br>THE MANOR HAD no other name, none that had stuck, anyway. Many called it the Green Manor, but that was more a description than a true title. To Cabe Bedlam, it was simply called the Manor. How long ago it had been built and by whom was a matter of conjecture. The style was like nothing the dark-haired warlock had ever seen before or since. Though much of the building had been cut from stone, the right side was actually formed by a massive tree as old as time. Depending where one stood in front of it, the Manor was either two or three stories tall. Marble columns jutted upward on each side of the doorway. Near the roof, the metallic effigy of one of the Seekers seemed ready to swoop down on any intruder.<br> <br>Some assumed it had been built by the avian race, in part because much of the statuary and artwork seemed to revolve around the lives of the bird folk. That a tree formed part of the Manor strengthened that theory. Yet, it always seemed strange that creatures who normally lived in the heavens and made their rookeries in high mountain caves would build so earthbound a home. It seemed more likely to Cabe that the statues and such had actually been added later on, long after the departure of the original builders.<br> <br>Actually, the history of the Manor meant far less to him than the fact that he was now its master. Here in the midst of the Dagora Forest, he and his wife, the enchantress Gwendolyn, ruled as lord and lady. Here, they raised the children . . . both human and drake.<br> <br>From his position on the second-floor balcony of their private quarters, Cabe could survey much of the vast garden of the Manor. He watched as servants of both races went about their duties or spent their free time enjoying the day. <i>The first time I saw this place, I was running for my life.</i><br> <br>The Dragon Kings had discovered him, the unknown and unassuming grandson of Nathan Bedlam, a sorcerer who had nearly brought down the ruling drakes. The silver streak in his hair, the mark of sorcery, would have been enough to condemn him already, for the drakes despised human mages, but the discovery of his an...</p><h2>A Raid Too Far: Operation Lam Son 719 and Vietnamization in Laos (Volume 143) (Williams-Ford Texas A&amp;M University Military History Series)</h2><p>In February 1971, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) launched an incursion into Laos in an attempt to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail and destroy North Vietnamese Army (NVA) base areas along the border. This movement would be the first real test of Vietnamization, Pres. Richard Nixon&#x2019;s program to turn the fighting over to South Vietnamese forces as US combat troops were withdrawn. US ground forces would support the operation from within South Vietnam and would pave the way to the border for ARVN troops, and US air support would cover the South Vietnamese forces once they entered Laos, but the South Vietnamese forces would attack on the ground alone.<br><br>The operation, dubbed Lam Son 719, went very well for the first few days, but as movement became bogged down the NVA rushed reinforcements to the battle and the ARVN forces found themselves under heavy attack. US airpower wreaked havoc on the North Vietnamese troops, but the South Vietnamese never regained momentum and ultimately began to withdraw back into their own country under heavy enemy pressure.<br><br>In this first in-depth study of this operation, military historian and Vietnam veteran James H. Willbanks traces the details of battle, analyzes what went wrong, and suggests insights into the difficulties currently being incurred with the training of indigenous forces.</p><p>JAMES H. WILLBANKS, General of the Army George C. Marshall Chair of Military History and director of the department of military history at the US Army Command and General Staff College in Leavenworth, Kansas, is also author of <i>The Tet Offensive: A Concise History</i> and <i>Abandoning Vietnam</i>."James Willbanks, a veteran of the Vietnam War and of the American advisory effort, reminds us of the importance of southeastern Laos to the Vietnam War in this carefully researched and clearly argued study. <i>A Raid Too Far</i>&nbsp;is richly rewarding for anyone interested in Operation Lam Son 719 and the later stages of the Vietnam War. Willbanks reveals the flaws in US and South Vietnamese strategy, the complexity of command, planning, and combat operations in an unequal coalition, and the heavy pressure of domestic politics on war fighting. A successful attack on the Ho Chi Minh Trail could have severely hurt the North Vietnamese war effort. But in the context of Vietnamization, the Nixon administration and the Pentagon pushed for an operation that was limited in nature yet still exceeded the capacity of the South Vietnamese army. Willbanks shows that by forcing ARVN units to operate without their US advisors, critical functions such as fire support could not be met adequately. Add to that difficult terrain, fissures within South Vietnamese command, and an enemy determined to fight and able to reinforce at critical points and the defeat of the South Vietnamese offensive appears predetermined. Remarkably, after the withdrawal from Laos, Nixon and Thieu publicly claimed success. In reality, Lam Son 719 deepened doubts among South Vietnamese leaders about the reliability of the US, and the campaign destroyed the confidence and morale of South Vietnam&#x2019;s soldiers."--Ingo Trauschweizer, author, <i>The Cold War U.S. Army</i> (Dr. Ingo Trauschweizer 2013-08-20)</p><h2>Why We Belong: Evangelical Unity and Denominational Diversity</h2><p><p>Denominations, although often maligned, are important for the continued health and vitality of the church.

It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."<br> ---David Rom�n, University of Southern California<br> What is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In <i>Utopia in Performance</i>, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.<br> <br> She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br></p></p><p>Scholar, critic, and theorist Jill Dolan is Zachary T.

Promising to bring peace, healing, and wholeness (even prosperity!) to its practitioners, readers will be shocked to discover that yoga is, in fact, based on the worship of (and prepares participants for supernatural connection with) unholy spirits that manifest in extraordinary and dangerous ways. The author&#x2014;an avid promoter of biblically based physical, mental, and spiritual wholeness&#x2014;distinguishes pure truth from popular belief in this revealing expose. Every Christian should be informed of the true origins and effects of the practice of yoga and its ungodly roots in Kundalini energy&#x2014;which, literally defined, means an awakening of the "Serpent Power."

He received a degree in mathematics from U.C.L.A. Marriage to his wife, Ruth, was followed by the birth of four children, a career as CPA/management consultant and, later, the management of several corporations. Along with church-related activities, Dave initiated and became involved in numerous campus ministries and meetings in his home, with a special outreach to Jewish young people and foreign students. Since 1973 Dave&#x2019;s desire for fulltime ministry has found fulfillment through authorship of books dealing with the incursion, into Western culture and the church itself, of Eastern, psychological and selfist philosophies, ecumenism, and other unbiblical teachings. Concern over Islamic politics and religion are reflected in current articles, lectures and interviews. At least 4 million copies of his books have been sold and have been translated into more than 50 languages. They include: The Cult Explosion, The God Makers, The New Spirituality, The Seduction of Christianity, Global Peace and the Rise of Antichrist, Occult Invasion, A Cup of Trembling, In Defense of the Faith, An Urgent Call to a Serious Faith , What Love Is This?, Countdown to the Second Coming, Seeking and Finding God, Honest Doubts, Judgment Day! Islam, Israel, and the Nations, Yoga and the Body of Christ, and his latest book, Cosmos, Creator and Human Destiny. His video, Israel, Islam &amp; Armageddon has become a tremendous tool for churches and others interested in helping spread the truth about events prior to and since the attack on the World Trade Center. Dave&#x2019;s impeccable research and recognized scholarship are based on in depth studies of original documents and publications, interviews with key experts from around the world, and extensive travel&#x2014;including to South America, Australia, Europe and throughout the Middle East.

His beloved wife Ruth was at his side.The fact that Christians are now practicing yoga in increasing numbers is puzzling in view of widely published warnings (many by yogis themselves, as well as by former yoga instructors) concerning its occult roots and attendant dangers, both spiritual and emotional.... Could this be one more sign of the apostasy that Christ (as well as Paul and other apostles) warned would characterize the Last Days just before our Lord&#x2019;s return to catch up His own out of this world to heaven in an event known as the Rapture? Or is yoga, as even some Christian leaders are now claiming, a biblical approach to God that was actually taught and practiced by Christ and the early church but because of prejudice was not recognized as such for 1,900 years by evangelicals? If so, why doesn&#x2019;t the word &#x201c;yoga&#x201d; appear even once in the Bible, and why are there no references in its pages to anyone engaging in any practice even remotely related?<br> <br> Even Hindus recognize the error in trying to &#x201c;Christianize&#x201d; yoga. In response to the fact that &#x201c;Christian yoga is a growing fitness craze,&#x201d; Subhas Tiwari, a professor at the Hindu University of America in Orlando, Florida, said, &#x201c;Hinduism is at yoga&#x2019;s core.&#x201d; Noting that yoga was practiced 3,000 years before the birth of Christ, mostly in India, Tiwari comments, &#x201c;If you give me a recipe and I alter the ingredients...and give it back to you, am I giving you the same thing? Clearly not.&#x201d;<br> <br> The total lack of biblical support seems not to trouble Christians practicing yoga&#x2014;and that is not a good sign. Is this fact related to Paul&#x2019;s solemn warning that in the last days &#x201c;some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils...&#x201d; (1 Timothy 4:1)? Of course, many Christians are not yet ready to disregard Scripture, but such a willingness seems to be gathering momentum.<br> <br> &#x201c;Christian yoga&#x201d;? How could that be? The falseness of such an idea should be clear from the fact that yoga originated long before Christ was born, and He certainly never practiced, taught, or commended it. Neither the apostles nor the early church engaged in yoga. One cannot just adopt a religious practice and call it Christianity. This faith was &#x201c;once [for all] delivered to the saints,&#x201d; and believers everywhere and at all times are exhorted to &#x201c;earnestly contend&#x201d; for it (Jude 3). It is therefore dishonest to introduce some new element&#x2014;particularly something like yoga, which comes from Hinduism&#x2014;and call it &#x201c;Christian.&#x201d;<br> <br> The truth is that the entire idea of &#x201c;Christian yoga&#x201d; has neither biblical nor historical basis but is of very recent origin. Scripture warns: &#x201c;To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them&#x201d; (Isaiah 8:20). If the Word of God is no longer the Christian&#x2019;s guide, what kind of &#x201c;Christianity&#x201d; could the practice of yoga be?<br> <br> Yoga originated in India as part of the paganism practiced there. How and when could it have become &#x201c;Christian&#x201d;? <br> The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ is &#x201c;the same yesterday, and today, and forever&#x201d; (Hebrews 13:8). Moreover, the biblical God declares, &#x201c;I...the Lord change not&#x201d; (Malachi 3:6). Those who teach and practice &#x201c;Christian yoga&#x201d; must have therefore departed from Scripture.</p><h2>The Church: A Guide for the Perplexed (Guides for the Perplexed)</h2><p>An upper-level introduction to the Christian doctrine of the Church. This book is a rigorous comprehensive introduction to the doctrine of the Church by taking the tack of walking readers through the internal logic of ecclesiology. Rather than simply offering a compendium of perspectives on each issue that arises, the authors seek to teach and model thinking theologically, with the grain of scripture and ecclesial reflection, about the Church. The chapters are peppered with two to three excurses per chapter which consider a particularly pertinent issue that arises from the doctrine&#39;s development (e.g. the move from Jesus to the Church, schism and the rise of denominations, sacramental mediation) or contemporary concerns (e.g. the question of other religions, contemporary ecumenical questions, the emerging church). While the overall tone and content of the book articulate and invite discussion on the problematics of ecclesiology, these excurses will provide ample opportunity to examine and (where appropriate) untangle ecclesiological knots. Continuum&#39;s Guides for the Perplexed are clear, concise and accessible introductions to thinkers, writers, and subjects that students and readers can find especially challenging - or indeed downright bewildering. Concentrating specifically on what it is that makes the subject difficult to grasp, these books explain and explore key themes and ideas, guiding the reader towards a thorough understanding of demanding material.</p><p>Matt Jenson is a systematic theologian in the Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University, La Mirada, CA.

Resurrecting a fascinating and forgotten tale, journalist Robert Love returns to the Gilded Age, when Dr. Pierre Bernard (n� Perry Baker in Iowa) revived a discipline banned in Victorian India, packaged it for Americans, and taught legions of followers, who bankrolled his luxurious Hudson River ashram- the first in the nation. Filled with Jazz Age celebrities, heiresses, spies, and outraged clergy, <i>The Great Oom</i> is the enthralling life story of the unlikeliest of gurus, and a stunning saga of mysticism, intrigue, and the American dream.</p><p>Robert Love was the managing editor of <i>Rolling Stone</i> and executive editor of <i>Best Life</i>.

This compelling history features movers and shakers from the worlds of entertainment, art, high society, finance, and industry." <br> -Mitch Anderson, <i>Yoga Journal</i> <br><br> "Part cultural history, part biography, part yarn-Bernard brings a suitably irreverent eye to Bernard's story and his less than purely spiritual appeal."<br> -Claire Dederer, <i>Slate</i> <br><br> "A striking reminder of the strange worlds to be found when traveling no farther than your own backyard." <br> -Robert Sabbag, author of <i>Snowblind</i> and <i>Down Around Midnight</i> <br><br> "If you're reading this after performing the downward dog in the morning, you likely have Bernard to thank . . . His wild and sprawling life . . . was one of those classic 'only in America' tales that has largely been forgotten until now." <br> -Tim Perone, <i>The New York Post</i> <br><br> "Over the last few decades, historians have realized the central role that Tantric yoga has played in America's embrace of Asian religions. What we didn't know was what a great love story it was. With <i>The Great Oom</i>, Robert Love has given us a marvelous early chapter of this American epic-in delightful, careful, and critical detail. Here we have none of the usual naivete or prudery and all of the sophistication and clear seeing that such a history demands." <br> -Jeffrey J. Kripal, professor of religious studies, Rice University, author of <i>Esalen: America and the Religion of No Religion</i> <br><br> "<i>The Great Oom</i> is a fascinating and important book about a fascinating and important individual. Love has done a brilliant job of excavating the life and times of Pierre Bernard, one of the first practitioners of yoga and Tantra in America and one of the most intriguing, controversial and entertaining figures in American history. Placing Bernard within the context of new spiritual trends, occultism and the fascination with India in the early 20th century, Love has shed important new light on the birth of yoga as a spiritual industry in modern America. It's a terrific read." <br> -Hugh Urban, professor of religious studies, Ohio State University, author of <i>The Economics of Ecstasy</i> <br><br> "Robert Love's entertaining biography depicts a bold and successful liar . . .

Mr. Love has the gift of the good biographer: he has sympathy for his subject's 'flamboyant weirdness' but the rigor to present him for what he was." <br> -<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <br><br> "A lively and idiosyncratic Bernard biography . . . [with] wonderful anecdotes [and] prodigious research . . . Best known as the Omnipotent Oom, [Bernard] is a colorful, still-marginal figure who was prescient about the popularity of yoga in American life. He was also a headline-making swami-entrepreneur who defied his bland Iowa origins to become one of the most renowned eccentrics of the Jazz Age. And the legacy of his program and his acolytes is still with us." <br> -Janet Maslin, <i>The New York Times</i> <br><br> "Throughout, Bernard is an attention-grabbing character, and Love does a wonderful job of drawing the reader into his world of magic and mischief. All lovers of biography will enjoy this book, as well as readers interested in yoga, or occult or esoteric practices." <br> -<i>Library Journal</i> <br><br> "The story of how the practice of yoga, physically enlivening and based in Eastern spiritualism, has made its way into contemporary American life and thought is fascinating, eminently readable and eye-opening at many levels." <br> -Scott Turow, best-selling author of <i>Presumed Innocent</i> and the forthcoming sequel <i>Innocent</i> <br><br> "I've never 'done' yoga. So what are the odds of me liking a 'yoga book'?

This is a jaw-dropping story unearthed from our recent history, full of sex and scandal and outrage, and its central figure, Pierre Bernard, is the equal of any schemer we Americans have yet given rise to." <br> -T.C. Boyle, best-selling author of <i>The Women</i> and <i>The Road to Wellville</i> <br><br> "This is a great book and nevermind that I'm personally more interested in getting out of uncomfortable positions than into them.

Ancient wisdom says that peace will follow you throughout your life. Scholar and author Ochs does not pretend to be a Joseph who can interpret dreams with divine help. She does, however, set the stage for individuals to tackle their own dreams from a Jewish perspective. Ochs admits that she once thought of dreams as part of her private life, not subject to Jewish laws and teachings, and that her own Jewish dream knowledge was limited to biblical stories and dream sequences from Fiddler on the Roof. Then she discovered the Talmudic tractate Berakhot (Blessings), which opened a rich new resource. "I learned that long after biblical dreamers such as Abraham and Joseph, who saw their dreams as encounters with God, and long before modern dream interpreters such as Freud and Jung, who saw dreams as insights into the unconscious mind, the best Jewish minds of antiquity were putting their heads together to make sense of dreaming." Written with her daughter Elizabeth, Ochs divides her book into two sections: an overview of Jewish teachings on dreams and their interpretation; and a variety of "dream practices," such as keeping a book of dreams and preparing for dream "incubation" (a kind of intentional dreaming to solve a problem or answer a question). This slender book, illustrated with vivid paintings in deep dream-like blues, can clear a new pathway to self-knowledge. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Designed for Dignity: What God Has Made It Possible for You To Be</h2><p>Even as Christians, we can puzzle over our self-image.

In <i>The Father</i> a mom is brought to madness and driven out of his home by the suspicion that his daughter is not his own child, while <i>Easter</i> centers on a family in need of redemption for its sins and suffering, and finding forgiveness at a season of rebirth.

Allewaert&#x2019;s examination of the writings of naturalists, novelists, and poets; the oral stories of Africans in the diaspora; and Afro-American fetish artifacts shows that persons in American plantation spaces were pulled into a web of environmental stresses, ranging from humidity to the demand for sugar. This in turn gave rise to modes of personhood explicitly attuned to human beings&#x2019; interrelation with nonhuman forces in a process we might call ecological.</p><br><p>Certainly the possibility that colonial life revokes human agency haunts works from Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>Tempest</i> and Montesquieu&#x2019;s <i>Spirit of the Laws</i> to Spivak&#x2019;s theories of subalternity. In Allewaert&#x2019;s interpretation, the transformation of colonial subjectivity into ecological personhood is not a nightmare; it is, rather, a mode of existence until now only glimmering in Che Guevara&#x2019;s dictum that postcolonial resistance is synonymous with &#x201c;perfect knowledge of the ground.&#x201d;<br></p></p><p><p><br>Monique Allewaert is assistant professor of English at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison. <br></p><p>"Timely, provocative, and incisive, <i>Ariel&#x2019;s Ecology</i> builds an impressive case for the emergence in the revolutionary Atlantic world of an &#x2018;ecological&#x2019; personhood in writings from and about plantation &#x2018;zones,&#x2019; variously authorized texts where &#x2018;vitality&#x2019; and &#x2018;agency&#x2019; heretofore thought by critics to have been abrogated from the enslaved and colonized emerge as byproducts of an &#x2018;assemblage&#x2019; of relations with the natural world. Monique Allewaert&#x2019;s important study will be of great interest to scholars working within and across multiple fields."&#x2014;Sean X. Goudie, Penn State University</p><br><br><p>"The book brims with theoretical and aesthetic insights on every page...With its inclusion of delightful botanical plates, rare archival documents, maps, engravings, and paintings, Ariel's Ecology will not only attract an interdisciplinary audience of scholars, educators, and students, but will also speak to a broader audience curious about subject formation in the American tropics."&#x2014;Southern Spaces</p><p>"With capacious readings across a wide range of print, manuscript, and oral texts both from the colonial period and beyond, Allewaert makes a methodological argument for the use of extra-generic sources in early American criticisms. A crucial intervention not only in materialist and postcolonial ecocriticisms, but also in political theory, diasporic American studies, and early American studies generally."&#x2014;<i>ISLE: Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment</i></p><p>"<i>Ariel&#x2019;s Ecology</i> provides a valuable, thought-provoking guide to this environment and those histories, and it will undoubtedly spur further thinking and writing in its wake."&#x2014;<i>Clio</i></p></p><h2>Angel Sanctuary, Vol. 12 (12)</h2><p>At the center of this epic tale of Heaven and Hell and forbidden love is high-school student Setsuna Mudo. He&#39;s no angel - he&#39;s completely tactless around girls, has an unpredictable temper, and can become extremely violent. That he comes from a broken home and is in love with his sister Sara just makes matters worse. Add teenage hormones and major issues with his mother, and you&#39;ve got the recipe for one troubled kid. And then Setuna&#39;s reality becomes seriously twisted when his past life as an angel comes to plague the present and threatens to destroy the future...</p><p>The artist and author of many a brilliant stories, including Angel Sanctuary, Blood Hound, Count Cain, Gravel Kingdom, and Boys Next Door</p><h2>Why Christian? For Those on the Edge of Faith</h2><p>In these dialogues with doubt, Hall enters into an earnest search with a young inquirer a composite of undergraduates, graduates, clergy, working people, his own children who is on the edges of Christian faith. Half familiar with superficial aspects of Christianity, hopeful of there being greater depth than has been found so far, she or he is curious, insistent, looking for something to believe in but not ready to leap without good reason. Such a person is asking, &#34;Why be Christian?&#34; In a passionate and personal way, Hall probes fundamental religious questions and wrestles with the cogency of basic Christian convictions about Jesus and God, about religious belief and the human predicament, about inauthentic forms of Christianity, about what is missing in human life today. Quoting Unamuno&#39;s dictum that &#34;Faith that does not doubt is dead faith,&#34; Hall&#39;s accessible and straightforward book helps readers to reclaim a Christianity of personal, intellectual, and moral integrity. This book may well prove a modern religious classic.</p><p>Douglas John Hall, Professor Emeritus of Theology at McGill University in Montreal, is one of North America&#39;s most respect theologians. With &#34;Confessing the Faith&#34; (1996), he has completed his great trilogy &#34;Christian Theology in a North American Context.&#34;</p><h2>Betsy and Saganaga: One Life, One Lake</h2><p>This is the story about the relationship between Betsy Powell and Saganaga Lake. For nearly 70 years, Betsy lived on this remote lake between the US and Canada, trapping, fishing, hunting and guiding fishing parties. She built her own cabin and traveled miles on foot and by boat for supplies, all without the luxuries of electricity or running water. The remarkable woman used her skills to survive, adapt and thrive on this lake, which is now a part of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.</p><p></p><h2>The Course of All Treasons: An Elizabethan Spy Mystery</h2><p><b>The Elizabethan court is beset by traitors at home and abroad as spies, rogues, and would-be usurpers of the throne vie for power.</b><br><br>England, 1586. Tensions rise as threats to the realm abound. Traitors are plotting for Mary Queen of Scots to depose Elizabeth I and take the throne. Rumors of a Spanish invasion by sea mount daily. And the body of one of Sir Francis Walsingham's agents is found floating in the Thames as other agents face enemies armed with crossbows and vials of poison.<br><br>Nicholas Holt, a spy in Walsingham's employ, narrowly averts the same fate while setting off in pursuit of the killer--or killers. And when he surprises a suspect in the company of a Spanish agent, he believes he's close not only to solving the case but preventing an act of high treason.<br><br>But soon, the attacks begin to threaten Nick's circle of friends. As those he loves face mortal peril, Nick must unravel the tangled plot, all the while steering a careful path through the fierce rivalry between Walsingham's agents and those of the Queen's favorite, the upstart Earl of Essex. Now it's a race to the breathless conclusion as Nick desperately searches for the answers that can save the day--and a vestige of loyalty that can save his own life.</p><p><b>Suzanne M.

He has a job that he loves as Chief of Police in the small Appalachian town of St. Germaine, North Carolina. He's employed as the part-time organist and choirmaster at St. Barnabas Church. He's just proposed to his sweetheart, Meg Farthing, and, to top it all off, he's as rich as a televangelist with his own 900 number. <p>In spite of all his apparent success, Hayden Konig's life-long dream is yet to be realized. He longs to write the next great hard-boiled mystery. Though his past attempts have been less than impressive, Hayden is convinced that using Raymond Chandler's actual typewriter (purchased at an auction) is just the impetus his writing needs to push his detective story over the top. Unfortunately, he's dead wrong. </p><p>St. Barnabas, meanwhile, has come into a great deal of money. Sixteen million dollars, to be exact, and the members of the congregation all have ideas on how to spend it. Suddenly, a shot rang out! A woman screamed, and Detective Konig has another dead body in the choir loft. It's business as usual in St. Germaine. With Easter right around the corner and suspects galore, Hayden must find the murderer.

If this source of 40 per cent of Germany&#39;s oil could be eliminated, it would deal a vital bodyblow to the Third Reich&#39;s ability to wage war, and a surprise attack by heavy B-24 Liberators flying at tree-top height was considered the best method of achieving success. Three bomb groups from the Eighth Air Force based in Britain flew out to join two groups of the Ninth already in North Africa, the combined force of 179 aircraft destined to carry out the first massed low-level heavy bomber mission in history. The Ploesti Raid took place on Sunday, August 1, 1943 and, but for a navigational error which put the leading formation on a course away from the target, the operation might have resulted in the destruction of the seven chosen targets. However, by the time the mistake was realised, the defences were on the alert and over 20 Liberators were brought down in and around Ploesti. A further 35 aircraft were lost. Although the operation resulted in the award of five Medals of Honor - America&#39;s highest decoration for bravery - the cost was high: 308 airmen lost their lives and 208 were taken prisoner or interned. Out of the 1,753 men who are known to have set out on the mission, a total of 516 had failed to return.</p><p></p><h2>C. S. Lewis&#39;s Dangerous Idea: In Defense of the Argument from Reason</h2><p>Who ought to hold claim to the more dangerous idea--Charles Darwin or C. S. Lewis? Daniel Dennett argued for Darwin in <em>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</em> (Touchstone Books, 1996). In this book Victor Reppert champions C. S. Lewis. Darwinists attempt to use science to show that our world and its inhabitants can be fully explained as the product of a mindless, purposeless system of physics and chemistry. But Lewis claimed in his argument from reason that if such materialism or naturalism were true then scientific reasoning itself could not be trusted. Victor Reppert believes that Lewis's arguments have been too often dismissed. In <em>C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea</em> Reppert offers careful, able development of Lewis's thought and demonstrates that the basic thrust of Lewis's argument from reason can bear up under the weight of the most serious philosophical attacks. Charging dismissive critics, Christian and not, with <em>ad hominem</em> arguments, Reppert also revisits the debate and subsequent interaction between Lewis and the philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe. And addressing those who might be afflicted with philosophical snobbery, Reppert demonstrates that Lewis's powerful philosophical instincts perhaps ought to place him among those other thinkers who, by contemporary standards, were also amateurs: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke and Hume. But even more than this, Reppert's work exemplifies the truth that the greatness of Lewis's mind is best measured, not by his ability to do our thinking for us, but by his capacity to provide sound direction for taking our own thought further up and further in.</p><p>Reppert (Ph. D., University of Illinois) is adjunct professor of philosophy at Glendale Community College in Glendale, Arizona. He is active in several C. S. Lewis societies, and he has written articles on Lewis's apologetics for such journals as <em>The Christian Scholar's Review, Philosophia Christi</em> and the <em>International Journal for Philosophy of Religion.</em>Reppert provides his readers a fresh, clear, and able exposition and defense of what he calls C. S. Lewis's dangerous idea: that a purely naturalistic account of the world cannot explain the reality of human rationality. A fine work. Well-written, the book glows with Reppert's engaging style and ability as an incisive thinker. This book represents a real advance in apologetics generally and Lewis scholarship specifically, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in either. (R. Keith Loftin, Christian Scholar's Review, Winter 2009)<br><br>. . .a fine work. Well-written, the book flows with engaging style. . .a real advance in apologetics generally and Lewis scholarship specifically. (R. Keith Loftin in Christian Scholar's Review, volume 37)<br><br>"Victor Reppert's book is a delight on two counts. First, it is a sophisticated and well-informed discussion of C. S. Lewis and his apologetic arguments, demolishing some well-known myths and demonstrating that Lewis had important and serious things to say as a philosopher. Second, and perhaps even more important, Reppert honors Lewis by developing and defending one of Lewis's central arguments against naturalism in a way that is both rigorous and readable, paying attention both to the objections raised against Lewis by Elisabeth Anscombe and to contemporary philosophical debates. This makes the book an important and original contribution to Christian apologetics in its own right." (C. Stephen Evans, University Professor of Philosophy and Humanities, Baylor University)<br><br>"According to the standard account, chapter three of C. S. Lewis's <em>Miracles,</em> his argument against naturalism, is a philosophical embarrassment, a beguiling house of cards that collapses at the merest breath of rigorous critique. Victor Reppert, in <em>C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea,</em> certainly proves the standard account wrong. But he does more than that: he deepens and extends Lewis's argument against naturalism and makes an intellectually exciting and persuasive case of his own. Reppert's book is philosophical revisionism at its finest." (Peter J. Kreeft and Ronald K. Tacelli, authors of Handbook of Christian Apologetics)<br><br>"One mark of a great apologist is that the apologist's central arguments are reappropriated and refined profitably by later thinkers. One mark of an outstanding Christian philosopher is the ability to do such work in a manner that meets the contemporary demands of philosophical argument. Victor Reppert has accomplished this in this clear, cogent and pertinent defense of the argument from reason. Consider it one more nail in the coffin of naturalism."

When he was eighteen years of age he was captured by the Indians, was adopted into one of their tribes, and lived with them as one of themselves until his escape in 1759. He became a lieutenant under General Bouquet during the expedition against the Ohio Indians in 1764, and was captain of a company of rangers in Lord Dunmore&#x2019;s War. In 1775 he was promoted to major of militia. He served in the Pennsylvania convention in 1776, and in the assembly in 1776-77. In the latter year he was commissioned colonel in command on the frontiers, and performed distinguished services. Smith moved to Kentucky in 1788. He was a member of the Danville convention, and represented Bourbon county for many years in the legislature. He died in Washington county, Kentucky, in 1812. The following narrative of his experience as member of an Indian tribe is from his own book entitled &#x201c;Remarkable Adventures in the Life and Travels of Colonel James Smith,&#x201d; printed at Lexington, Kentucky, in 1799. It affords a striking contrast to the terrible experiences of the other captives whose stories are republished in this book; for he was well treated, and stayed so long with his red captors that he acquired expert knowledge of their arts and customs, and deep insight into their character.

And yet with each unexpected moment, the actions of the characters, because he has given such care to them, remain true and consistent, becoming the anchor in the wild ride.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Comics Beat</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Joshua Cotter's unique and exquisitely dense dystopian science fiction tale is a provocative commentary on our rapid technological progress and the abject effect it can have on humanity. <em>Nod Away</em>&nbsp;is filled with beautiful black and white line art and exceptional comic book storytelling.

Later pirates and plunderers entered through the inlet and wreaked havoc, and American Indian chief Wildcat terrorized the area. Federal navy cannonading destroyed the community in 1863, and the freezes of 1895 and 1896 decimated the orange groves. The people of New Smyrna persevered through it all to make New Smyrna the charming community it is today.

Let dry for fifteen minutes or until mask begins to harden and crack. Rinse with warm water. Pat dry.&#x201d;<br><br>Gazing at her image in the guest-bathroom mirror, Meredith began to follow the instructions, using upward motions from her throat to her chin. She had heard once that all lotions and cleansers should be applied with upward motions as an act of defiance against gravity. Not that her twenty-four-year-old face was ready to wage war with gravity. Meredith just liked to think she had some control over her looks.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why she colored her hair. She had for years. One of her three older sisters, Shelly, had teased Meredith a few weeks ago, saying she was a recovering brunette.

Her face was now covered in a subtle shade of lime. And she was enjoying every minute of this royal treatment.<br><br>She raised her eyebrows and watched the lines forming on her forehead. It resembled the way her mother looked when she was worried, and Meredith didn&#x2019;t like that. To her, people who walked around with wrinkled, worried foreheads were people who had no imaginations.<br><br>Meredith tilted up her chin and checked on the gooey green lotion rapidly drying on her neck. She tucked the blue plastic bonnet behind her right ear and made a gruesome face in the mirror as the drying mask cracked across her cheeks. With her best cackle, Meri squinted her left eye and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you yet, my pretty!&#x201d;<br><br>The country-western music floating from the portable radio came to an end on her third cackle, and Meredith listened closely. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s 8:42 on this gorgeous first Saturday morning in May,&#x201d; the smooth voice of the female announcer said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for a high today in Glenbrooke Valley of seventy-eight degrees.

Meredith flipped the &#x201c;off&#x201d; switch and rummaged in her cosmetics bag for her travelsized toothpaste and soap. Not that she needed to use her own. Jessica and Kyle had provided plenty of everything for the guests who were staying at their restored Victorian home for the big weekend event.<br><br>The room assigned to Meredith was the Patchwork Bedroom. Some of the women of Glenbrooke had made the patchwork quilt that graced the large brass bed. A framed square of patchwork fabric over the bed was part of a quilt made by a pioneer woman who had migrated west on the Oregon Trail more than 150 years ago. Jessica had been given the treasured piece by the pioneer&#x2019;s great-great-granddaughter.<br><br>This turret room was originally a storage place until Jessica transformed it into another guest room. Kyle had recently built on this small adjacent bathroom where Meredith stood, checking the timer on her watch. Four more minutes until she could hop into the shower.<br><br>The big kickoff at the camp wasn&#x2019;t until noon, but Meredith had promised her sister Shelly she would show up early to help with all the preparations. Shelly and her childhood sweetheart, Jonathan, had married in Seattle a year ago this weekend. They moved to Glenbrooke, where they worked side by side to develop a conference center in the woods. Kyle and Jessica owned the property and had had the original vision for the camp. About six months ago, in a broad stroke of generosity and trust, Kyle and Jess turned the whole project over to Jonathan and Shelly. And today was the grand opening of Heather Creek Conference Center.<br><br>Meredith squirted some toothpaste onto her toothbrush and made another wild Martian grin in the mirror. As the sample packet had promised, her face felt cracked. Time to hop into the shower.<br><br>Right before she turned on the water, Meredith realized she didn&#x2019;t have her clothes in the bathroom because she had been trying to decide what to wear. She had made the bed all sweet and tidy, almost as if she were afraid her mother would come in to check on her and scold her if it wasn&#x2019;t made yet. Then&nbsp;Meredith had tucked her luggage neatly in the corner of the room and decided that if Mom did come in for a room check, she would have nothing to criticize.<br><br>Meredith stuck the toothbrush in her mouth and began to scrub her teeth, grinning at her own gruesome appearance in the mirror. The blue-tinted &#x201c;skull cap,&#x201d; lime green cracked face, and foam now dripping from the corner of her mouth added up to quite a sight. If Mom checked on Meredith now, she would be in for a life-altering shock.<br><br>Opening the bathroom door, Meredith stepped into the guest room and headed for her suitcases in the corner. The cooler air of the bedroom chilled her legs under her big blue nightshirt as her bare feet padded across the room. She unzipped the bag with both hands, sucking on the toothbrush in her mouth, and pulled out her underwear, a white cotton shirt, and a pair of shorts.<br><br>Rising with her arms full, Meredith was starting back to the bathroom when she froze in place. She dropped her shorts and unwillingly swallowed the toothpaste foam in her mouth. She couldn&#x2019;t move. She couldn&#x2019;t scream. All she could do was stare.<br><br>A man was asleep on her bed. He had on all his clothes&#x2014; even his shoes&#x2014;and he looked as if he had dropped on the bed in a dead faint with his arms straight out to the sides and his palms up.<br><br>The man opened his eyes, then closed them. Suddenly his large brown eyes sprung open again. He shot straight up in bed. He stared at Meredith and let out a wild yelp that sounded like an animal caught in a trap.<br><br>Meredith screamed, too.<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he yelled.<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; she yelled back, grasping her toothbrush like a dagger.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing in my room?&#x201d; The poor guy&#x2019;s face looked terrified.<br><br>Meredith realized her face looked, well...&#x201c;This is my room!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;What are you doing in my bed?&#x201d;<br><br>In a confused stupor, the man tumbled from the bed and frantically grabbed his garment bag by the door. With one last bewildered and horrified glance at Meredith, the Avocado Alien, the tall, sunny blond male scrambled out the door.<br><br>For dramatic effect she slammed the door and locked it with a snap. She stood still, her back to the door, listening. Waiting. Her heart pounding. Wondering if anyone had heard them or if he would come back. She scanned the room for any more of his belongings. It appeared he had taken everything.<br><br>As soon as her pulse slowed down, she moved away from the door and gathered up her strewn articles of clothing. I can&#x2019;t believe that just happened! I probably shouldn&#x2019;t have yelled at the poor guy. He looked awfully confused. What am I saying? He invaded my privacy! I should have thrown something at him.<br><br>Marching into the bathroom, Meredith turned on the shower with a twist of the handle. Her hands were still shaking. It really was my fault. I should have locked the door. But how could he have gotten the wrong room? And why would he be asleep at nine in the morning?<br><br>Meri adjusted the shower curtain so the water wouldn&#x2019;t drip on the tile floor. What if he was waiting for me? Maybe he does landscaping around here, and he heard that a lovely young princess was staying in the corner turret, and he wanted to meet me so...<br><br>Meredith looked at herself in the mirror, and the fanciful fairy tale vanished with a poof. She smiled. Then she let loose her silvery, wind-chime laughter, spilling it all over the bathroom floor. &#x201c;Look at you, Meri Jane Graham. You are a fright to behold! You scared that poor guy to death.&#x201d;<br><br>She slipped into the warm shower still laughing. It felt great to rinse out the cold, smelly hair coloring and to liberate her cracked face.</p><h2>The Poetry of Pop</h2><p><b>From Tin Pan Alley to the Beatles to Beyonc�, "Mr. Bradley skillfully breaks down a century of standards and pop songs into their elements to reveal the interaction of craft and art in composition and performance.&#x201d; (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)</b><br><br> Encompassing a century of recorded music, this pathbreaking book reveals the poetic artistry of popular songs. Pop songs are music first. They also comprise the most widely disseminated poetic expression of our time. Adam Bradley traces the song lyric across musical genres from early twentieth-century Delta blues to mid-century rock 'n&#x2019; roll to today&#x2019;s hits. George and Ira Gershwin&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fascinating Rhythm.&#x201d; The Rolling Stones&#x2019; &#x201c;(I Can&#x2019;t Get No) Satisfaction.&#x201d; Rihanna&#x2019;s &#x201c;Diamonds.&#x201d; These songs are united in their exacting attention to the craft of language and sound. Bradley shows that pop music is a poetry that must be heard more than read, uncovering the rhythms, rhymes, and metaphors expressed in the singing voice. At once a work of musical interpretation, cultural analysis, literary criticism, and personal storytelling, this book illustrates how words and music come together to produce compelling poetry, often where we least expect it.</p><p><b>Adam Bradley</b> is professor of English and founding director of the Laboratory for Race &amp; Popular Culture (RAP Lab) at the University of Colorado Boulder. He is the author of <i>Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop</i> and coeditor of <i>The Anthology of Rap</i>."Bradley skillfully breaks down a century of standards and pop songs into their elements to reveal the interaction of craft and art in composition and performance."&#x2014;Dominic Green, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>"Adam Bradley is unafraid to blur the boundaries . . . he can be warm and insightful.&nbsp;He highlights differences between modern poetry and pop music by arguing that if you showed an ancient Greek or an Elizabethan Ashberry&#x2019;s poem 'by an Earthquake' alongside Taylor Swift&#x2019;s 'Blank Space,' the time travellers would identify the neatly rhyming Swift as the poet."&#x2014;Victoria Segal, <i>Sunday Times&nbsp;</i>(London)<br>"A sort of readers&#x2019; manual for pop, calmly taking the reader through the different aspects of analysing songs, and thereby appreciating them better. . . . What elevates <i>The Poetry of Pop</i>, though, is the continuous animating presence of Bradley&#x2019;s humour, intelligence and eye for detail.&nbsp;. . . I have never read a smarter, clearer or more compelling guide to reading poetry."&#x2014;Tim Smith-Laing, <i>Daily Telegraph</i><br>"Bradley deploys a formidable set of skills. He has an acute ear, dazzling command of seemingly the entire history of pop and a pleasingly wide range of taste, drawing on examples from Gershwin to Guns 'n' Roses to make his points. His prose has precision and clarity when discussing even the most recondite of literary terms. As with all good teachers, his passion for his subject animates his writing and makes his enthusiasm nearly communicable."&#x2014;Michael Lindgren, <i>Washington Post</i><br>"Having wrestled with the poetics of rap and hip-hop in his earlier tomes, Bradley here buckles the reader into place for a trip through the myriad effects of pop. . . .

Its critical m�lange of literary criticism, musicology, neuroscience, and songwriters is especially apt, imaginative, and noteworthy."&#x2014;Anthony Bolden, University of Kansas<br>"This book mounts a powerful defense of pop music&#x2019;s artistry. Bradley&#x2019;s book is filled with provocative claims, offered clearly, intelligently, and persuasively."&#x2014;David Caplan, Ohio Wesleyan University<br>"Adam Bradley ingeniously unknots an argument ongoing since the first listener spun down the AM dial in search of the right song: what is the relationship between the words and notes in pop music? With accessible virtuosity, Bradley examines pop music&#x2019;s motifs and lyric gestures in new and wholly unexpected ways.

My father stalked across the entry hall, waving a slip of paper at me with his good hand.<br> <br>Hatcher flashed me a sympathetic look and vanished upstairs. I didn&#x2019;t blame him; I&#x2019;d have done the same thing in his place. No one wants to face the wrath of Lieutenant Colonel Jericho T. Lovejoy.<br> <br>&#x201c;An F plus in pre-algebra?&#x201d; The chill in my father&#x2019;s voice could have single-handledly reversed global warming. &#x201c;F plus, Truly?&#x201d;<br> <br>Yes, that&#x2019;s really my name. It&#x2019;s a family thing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does that mean you almost passed, or that you failed spectacularly?&#x201d; My father pinned me with one of his signature glares.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t counted on this&#x2014;I thought it would take at least a week for mail from Texas to reach the East Coast. And I&#x2019;d counted on being able to snag this particular envelope from the mailbox before anyone else spotted it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is unacceptable, young lady.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence is the best strategy when my father gets like this.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand it,&#x201d; he continued, pacing back and forth. &#x201c;Not one bit. Lovejoys can do anything! We&#x2019;re naturally good at math.&#x201d;<br> <br>Actually, there&#x2019;s a whole long list of things I can&#x2019;t do and that I&#x2019;m not good at. Usually, though, math isn&#x2019;t one of them. It&#x2019;s one of my favorite subjects, in fact. But how was I supposed to concentrate on stupid pre-algebra when my world had been turned upside down?

No point adding fuel to the fire. &#x201c;Wait until your mother hears about this.&#x201d;<br> <br>That wasn&#x2019;t a conversation I was looking forward to. When my father&#x2019;s mad, at least everything&#x2019;s out in the open and you know where you stand.

Yet those in his immediate circle believed he was a great man who should be president of the United States. <br> <br> Jackson's election in 1828 is usually viewed as a result of the expansion of democracy. Historians David and Jeanne Heidler argue that he actually owed his victory to his closest supporters, who wrote hagiographies of him, founded newspapers to savage his enemies, and built a political network that was always on message. In transforming a difficult man into a paragon of republican virtue, the Jacksonites exploded the old order and created a mode of electioneering that has been mimicked ever since. <br></p><p><b>David S.

He wants to keep Friday but his mother, who runs a less-than-successful bed-and-breakfast business, insists that they turn him over to the RSPCA for seven days in case his owners call to claim him. In the meantime, Robin gets to know the new next-door neighbors?a cheerful, wildly nutty bunch of kids, one of whom is emotionally disturbed?and must deal with Dan, a bully. When Robin sees a notice about a lost dog that fits Friday's description, he is overcome with guilt and decides to notify the animal's rightful owners. Fortunately, it is a case of mistaken identity, and in the end Robin and his canine pal are able to stay together. This is a poignant novel about honesty and the complexities of friendship. All the characters are well drawn and Robin's sensitive nature will appeal to readers. The British coast setting and language may be difficult for some readers to identify with; nevertheless, the story is entertaining, funny, and thoughtful, and the characters have depth.?Ann M.

J. O&#39;Rourke has written eighteen books on subjects as diverse as politics and cars and etiquette and economics. Parliament of Whores and Give War a Chance both reached #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. He is a contributing editor at the Weekly Standard, H. L. Mencken Research Fellow at the Cato Institute, a regular panellist on NPR&#39;s Wait Wait . . . Don&#39;t Tell Me, and editor-in-chief of the web magazine American Consequences. He lives in rural New England, as far away from the things he writes about as he can get.As a cultural analyst, O&#39;Rourke&#39;s ability and willingness to simultaneously lampoon and celebrate himself and his generation are unequaled. * Publishers Weekly * Outspoken conservatives have long been a minority in comedy, particularly in the mainstream media, which provided an opportunity for P.J. O&#39;Rourke, who for decades cornered the market for prominent right-wing humorists . . . If his wry essays have a mission statement . . . it&#39;s this: Starchy -Republicanism is really, really fun. * New York Times Book Review * [O&#39;Rourke] occupies a rare place among the laughing class: He has somehow avoided the orifice obsession that captivates many of its members; he identifies as Republican; and he is no mere thumb-sucker, having visited more than 40 countries to report on wars, regime changes, economic revolutions and the experience of drinking cocktails garnished with the poison sacs of cobras. * Wall Street Journal * P.J. O&#39;Rourke was really the first to inject non-liberal hilarity into political discourse . . . But more important, he was able to yank conservatives out of the hands of the humorless and shrill, and make such writing accessible . . . He changed my life. * Greg Gutfeld * P.J. O&#39;Rourke is like S.J. Perelman on acid. * Chris Buckley * Who better than one of America&#39;s most-respected humourists to make sense of an election in which real life frequently appeared to approach satire? * The Week * Whether you agree with him or not, P.J. writes a helluva piece. * Richard Nixon * O&#39;Rourke has been for decades the wittiest guide to America, and the usual ingredients are packed into this volume. How the Hell Did This Happen? is scabrously witty, inventive and rich in historical detail. * The Australian * O&#39;Rourke has a real eye for the vagaries of American politics and, on occasion, piercing insight. * Observer * extremely funny * Sunday Times * scabrously witty, inventive and rich in historical detail... O&#39;Rourke is never less than pleasurable company. There were chapters in this book I read twice just for the fun of it... I am already looking forward to the companion volume What The Hell Happens Next? * The Times * O&#39;Rourke has a nice, world-weary way with the US&#39;s present political follies... He hasn&#39;t lost his gift for the brutally effective one-liner. * Guardian *</p><h2>Huns &amp; Hun Hunting: The History, Habits, Habitat, and Techniques of Hunting a Great Game Bird</h2><p>This popular author shares 40 years worth of knowledge gleaned while studying and hunting one of wing-shooting&#39;s most challenging game birds: the Hungarian partridge.</p><p><p>Ben O.

She was beginning to think this journey through Scotland would never end. She tucked her hands back inside her fur muff, deciding that sliding about on the seat was preferable to frozen fingers.<br> <br>Thank heavens for the muff, a remnant of her life in her father&#x2019;s house. After all these years, it was a mite bedraggled, but it still kept her hands toasty. Her practical flannel petticoats and woolen carriage dress were warm as well. She wished she could say the same for her ice-cold feet. It was not that she was unused to difficult weather or rough travel; she had accompanied Lionel to other sites throughout Britain, subjecting herself to every extreme of cold, heat, and rain. But she had not been prepared for how cold it was in late October in the Highlands of Scotland.<br> <br>Still, she had been right to come early, instead of waiting for spring as Uncle Lionel would have done if he were still alive. Her situation was entirely different now. Violet swallowed hard at the thought of her mentor. She would not cry. Lionel himself would have pointed out that it was ineffective and unnecessary. Her tears would not bring him back, and she must not arrive at her future patron&#x2019;s home looking woebegone and red-eyed. She had to be firm, strong, and professional if she hoped to convince the earl that she was the person most fit to take her uncle&#x2019;s place.<br> <br>It was vital that she seize this opportunity before other antiquarians heard of it. Before the Earl of Mardoun learned of her uncle&#x2019;s death and offered the ruins to someone he deemed more worthy&#x2014;in short, to a man.<br> <br>Violet suppressed a sigh. It was no use thinking of the inequities of life. She was accustomed to the ways of the world. She had long since learned that she must struggle for everything she accomplished. Only Lionel had accepted her abilities.<br> <br>At a muffled shout, the carriage halted abruptly, sending Violet sliding from her seat and onto the floor of the post chaise. She sat up, a trifle stunned, hearing more voices, followed by a loud crack. Was that a gun? Violet jumped to her feet and flung open the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;What in the&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped, her mouth dropping open at the scene before her.<br> <br>It was dark, for evening fell early here, and the scene was illuminated by only the lantern in the postboy&#x2019;s trembling hand. The lad was huddled on the lead horse, bundled up against the cold till only his reddened nose and wide, frightened eyes were visible above the woolen scarf. Two men blocked the narrow roadway, facing the post chaise, four others to the side of the road. They were attired in similar bulky clothing, hats pulled low on their heads and thick woolen scarves wrapped around their necks and lower faces, making it almost impossible to discern their features in the poor light. It was easy to see, however, that one of them held a musket trained on the postboy, and two more carried pistols.<br> <br>Anger surged in Violet. &#x201c;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing? Stand aside and let us pass.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Och! A wee Sassenach,&#x201d; one of the men cried gleefully, his words muffled by the scarf.<br> <br>Between his thick accent and the cloth covering his mouth, Violet could make little sense of what he said, but she understood the word wee well enough, and it added fuel to the fire of her anger.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get out of my way.&#x201d; Violet&#x2019;s eyes flashed. &#x201c;I do not think the Earl of Mardoun will be pleased that you detained his guest.&#x201d; Guest, of course, was stretching the truth since Mardoun had no idea she was coming, but the principle was the same.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oooh, the Earl of Mardoun, is it? Noo I&#x2019;m shaking in my boots.&#x201d; He laughed, and the men around him joined in. &#x201c;Throw doon your jewels, lassie, and your purse, too. Then we&#x2019;ll let you gae on your way . . . if you ask nicely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t any jewels.&#x201d; Her chin jutted stubbornly. She had precious little money in her reticule either after paying the expenses of this journey. If she gave it up, she would be utterly penniless.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s those bobs in your ears, then!&#x201d; He gestured at her with his pistol.<br> <br>Violet&#x2019;s hands flew up to her ears, knocking her bonnet back. &#x201c;My grandmother&#x2019;s drops! No! Absolutely not.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man&#x2019;s jaw dropped in surprise at her defiance and so did his pistol hand, so that for an instant Violet thought she might have won the day, but then he scowled and started toward her. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re wanting to pay me some ither way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Violet knew that her fury and, yes, fear had carried her too far, but though her stomach clenched with dread, she reached back inside the carriage and grabbed her umbrella, turning to face her opponent. Again the man halted in astonishment. One of the men let out a hoot, and everyone laughed.<br> <br>Her enemy&#x2019;s face darkened, and he rushed forward. Violet swung with all her might, and the umbrella whacked into the side of his head. He let out a screech and stumbled back. But her umbrella had snapped beneath the blow. Violet had no idea what she would do now. She braced herself.<br> <br>Suddenly, with a shout, a large man hurtled out of the darkness into the circle of light cast by the postboy&#x2019;s lantern. He charged straight toward Violet.<br> <br>Startled, Violet swept down the umbrella as hard as she could, though its being broken rendered the blow feeble. In the next instant, she realized that the newcomer had grabbed not her, but the fellow who had accosted her.<br> <br>Her apparent rescuer turned to her in astonishment, still holding the front of her attacker&#x2019;s jacket with one hand, and reached up with the other to yank the umbrella from her hand. &#x201c;What is the matter with you? I&#x2019;m trying to help you!&#x201d; He tossed the umbrella onto the carriage floor behind her and turned back to the man he still held in place with one huge fist. Digging his hands into her attacker&#x2019;s jacket, he lifted him up so that only his toes touched the ground. &#x201c;What the bloody hell are you doing, Will?&#x201d;<br> <br>For once bereft of words, Violet could only stare at her rescuer. He was a behemoth, towering over everyone else. His wide shoulders owed little to the heavy jacket he wore, and his broad, long-fingered hands held the other man up as if he weighed no more than a child. Seemingly impervious to the elements, he wore no muffler or cap, and his jacket hung open down the front. His thick, tousled hair glowed golden in the light of the lantern.<br> <br>He shoved the man he called Will to the other side of the road, saying disgustedly, &#x201c;Is this what you&#x2019;ve come to?&#x201d; He moved his scornful gaze over the row of men. &#x201c;Preying on travelers like a band of reivers! Robbing innocent women! I&#x2019;m ashamed to call you Highlanders. Look at her.&#x201d; He swung his hand toward Violet. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just a wee lassie! Hardly bigger than a child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wee!&#x201d; Violet bristled at his description of her.<br> <br>He swung around and glared. &#x201c;Aye, wee. And apparently mad as a hatter as well. Canna you see I&#x2019;m trying to help you? What the devil is your husband thinking, letting you jaunt about the countryside alone at night? The man should have better sense.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me? Let me?&#x201d; Violet stiffened. &#x201c;Fortunately, I am not married, so I need no man&#x2019;s permission to go where I please and do what I want. I make my own decisions about my life. And I may be &#x2018;wee,&#x2019; but I am no child. Just because I&#x2019;m not . . . a . . . a giant doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m not capable of taking care of myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>He swept his eyes down her in one swift, encompassing glance. At some other time, Violet might have found his strong features handsome, but at the moment, she saw nothing except the scorn in his eyes. His mouth quirked up on one side. &#x201c;Oh, aye, I can see that you are doing splendidly. No doubt your broken umbrella would hold off any number of men.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you.&#x201d; Violet knew her words were untrue, even silly, but she was too angry to be reasonable. Primed as she was for battle and with a lifetime of male belittling to fuel her wrath, this huge, supremely confident man&#x2019;s dismissal of her sparked her fury. Her hands clenched. She had a strong desire to hit him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you not?&#x201d; His eyes widened, something between heat and challenge flashing in them before he drew his brows together in a scowl. &#x201c;I dinna ken whether you&#x2019;re blind or silly, but there is only one of you&#x2014;one small one&#x2014;and you wouldna have won this fight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did not ask for your help.&#x201d;<br> <br>One of the men chuckled, spurring her aggravation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nae, you dinna,&#x201d; her rescuer shot back. &#x201c;And I am beginning to regret offering it. Now would you cease this jabbering and get back in your carriage and let me handle this?&#x201d; He swung around, effectively dismissing her, and addressed the other men again. &#x201c;Give up this idiocy before the lot of you wind up with your necks in a noose.&#x201d; He gestured toward the men blocking the carriage&#x2019;s way, and they dropped their gazes, shuffling over to the side of the road. &#x201c;Rob Grant, what would your gran say if she knew you were out frightening young lassies like this?&#x201d; One of the robbers turned his head away, easing back behind the others. &#x201c;And Dennis MacLeod. You should be ashamed of yourself. You&#x2019;ve a wife and bairns at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man lifted his chin. &#x201c;Aye, and I hae to provide for them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you best be tending to your croft, hadn&#x2019;t you? Stealing from travelers won&#x2019;t mend the thatch on your roof. And May and the bairn will be hard-pressed to raise the crops alone next spring while you&#x2019;re sitting in gaol.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all easy for you to say, Coll, now that you&#x2019;re one of them,&#x201d; Will said.<br> <br>One of whom, Violet wondered&#x2014;and was Coll her rescuer&#x2019;s name? It seemed odd, but then, there was nothing about this situation that was not odd.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sitting all snug and bonny, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Will went on bitterly. &#x201c;Carrying out his lordship&#x2019;s orders. You used to be one of us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am not one of them,&#x201d; Coll retorted in a goaded voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m of this glen, same as I&#x2019;ve always been. I dinna take on this job for him. I did it for the crofters. There willna be any more families tossed out of their homes.&#x201d;<br> <br>The other man let out a snort of disbelief. &#x201c;For how long?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For as long as I&#x2019;ve breath in this body. Dinna try me, Will. I have no hope for you any longer; you&#x2019;re on your way to the gallows as fast and straight as you can go. But I willna let you take the others with you.&#x201d; Coll took a long step forward. &#x201c;Is that clear?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye.&#x201d; Will set his jaw, not meeting Coll&#x2019;s gaze.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then be off.&#x201d; He swept them all with an encompassing gaze, then crossed his arms and waited. The other men began to melt back into the trees. In moments, they were gone.<br> <br>Violet watched with a jaundiced eye. It must be handy to be able to shake others into submission. Authority came easily to such a man. He had saved her and she must be grateful for that. But she had too often been shoved into the background by men who were louder, larger, and stronger than she to like this bully who had come to her rescue. His obvious contempt for her rankled. Like all men, he did not see her as a person in her own right, but only a possession of a husband or father.<br> <br>He swung back to her. Disconcertingly, even though she stood on the step of the carriage, his face was level with hers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you going to issue orders to me now?&#x201d; Violet arched a brow, her hands on her hips.<br> <br>He took in her pugnacious stance and, irritatingly, smiled. &#x201c;You are a bonny bruiser, are you not? Nae, I have no orders for you, though someone should have taken better care of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I take care of myself. I am a grown woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, I can see that for myself.&#x201d; Casually he planted one hand on the carriage, leaning against it. &#x201c;Still, you&#x2019;re a stranger to the Highlands. And these roads.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have become quite well acquainted with these roads, believe me.&#x201d;<br> <br>His mouth twitched, but he said only, &#x201c;You shouldna be out here at night. It&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you threatening me now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; He stared. &#x201c;You think I would harm you? I&#x2019;m the one who just came to your rescue, if you&#x2019;ll recall.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You chased off one set of thieves. But how am I to know you were not simply eliminating the competition?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Och, but you&#x2019;ve a bitter tongue on you. Most people would have been grateful for my aid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. No doubt I should have fainted. Or perhaps you expect payment?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A simple &#x2018;thank you&#x2019; would have sufficed. But I can see there&#x2019;s little likelihood of that. So I&#x2019;ll choose payment.&#x201d; One large hand clamped around her nape, holding her still, and he leaned in to kiss her.<br> <br>The touch of his lips was brief and soft, and it sent a shiver through her. Violet&#x2019;s lips parted in surprise. He raised his head, and his eyes roamed her face, settling on her lips. &#x201c;I think perhaps my price has gone up.&#x201d;<br> <br>His mouth came down on hers again. He tasted her, the kiss slow and lingering. His tongue teased along the parting of her lips, then slipped inside to caress and explore. Heat surged in Violet, every sense suddenly wildly alive. She had never felt anything like this before, and the onslaught of heat and pleasure stunned her.<br> <br>He made a low, satisfied sound deep in his throat, and his arm came down to curl around her waist. &#x201c;Sweet,&#x201d; he murmured against her lips.<br> <br>The word shot through her, waking her from her daze. Sweet. Wee. Melting in his strong, masculine arms.<br> <br>Violet jerked out of his grasp and jumped back into the carriage, calling to the postboy to drive on. The vehicle rumbled away, leaving Coll staring after it in surprise. Violet did not look back.<br> <br>She crossed her arms, unsure if her trembling was the result of the cold or delayed fright or the strange, delicious sensations that had flooded through her. The man was impertinent. Forward. Overbearing. Rude. Crude. Obviously the sort who was accustomed to shouldering his way through life, expecting men to stand aside and women to fall into his arms. And why not? That was exactly what had happened.<br> <br>Shame washed over Violet. How could she have reacted like that? She had spent all her life fighting men&#x2019;s opinion of women as weak, emotional, and incompetent, yet in an instant she had thrown it all away. She had been scared and in need of rescue, and when he kissed her, she had not even had the fortitude to push him away. No, she had just stood there, helpless, betrayed by her own body, while he held her still and took what he wanted.<br> <br>No, he had not taken; she had been happy to give it to him. Indeed, she had been on the verge of throwing her arms around him and asking for more. Violet closed her eyes, remembering the feel of his mouth on hers, the velvet softness, the way his lips had moved over hers, the touch of his tongue. She let out a soft noise that was as much pleasure as anger. She barely paid attention to the village as the post chaise rolled through it and turned off onto a smaller road. She was too busy trying to calm her racing pulse and banish the heat that pooled low in her abdomen. It would be disastrous to face her new employer in this shaken, frayed, tender state.<br> <br>Violet took a calming breath and then another. That was a little better. At least she had, in the end, come to her senses and pulled away from him.

There her parents were part of a vibrant artistic community that included Aldous Huxley, Bernard Berenson, and D. H. Lawrence. Meanwhile, Kinta and her brother explored the glorious countryside, participated in the region's many seasonal rites and rituals, and came to know and love the charming, resilient Italian people. With the coming of World War II the family had to leave Aulla; years later, though, Kinta would return to witness the courage and skill of the Tuscan people as they rebuilt their lives. Lyrical and witty, <b>A Tuscan Childhood</b> is alive with the timeless splendour of Italy.</p><p>What could be more romantic than living in an ancient fortress, dining in its rooftop garden, and sleeping under the stars? English artists and intellectuals like the author's parents (painter Aubrey Waterfield and journalist Lina Duff Gordon) have traditionally adored the Italian countryside, and their daughter's enchanting memoir describes the happy haven they found near the Tuscan town of Aulla. Kinta was only 5 in 1916 when she made her first trip by pony trap up the steep road to their hilltop abode, and neither exile to English boarding school nor the Second World War could keep her away for long. Famous friends like Bernard Berenson and D.H. Lawrence make cameo appearances, but the real stars are the earthy, dignified Tuscan peasants who worked for her family. Through them, the author immersed herself in the timeless rhythms of rural existence. The text's highlights include a vivid account of <i>vendemmia</i>, the grape harvest, and the glories of Italian cuisine. Anyone who can read her descriptions of the local polenta, <i>zuppa di verdura</i>, and other meticulously prepared dishes without feeling a rumble in the stomach truly has no interest in food. Though Beevor's final chapters note the changes that have come to Tuscany in the postwar era, her recollections pay loving tribute to a way of life that truly seems eternal. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"Wonderful...[Kinta Beevor has] that special English grasp of grandeur and simplicity....I fell immediately into her world, and was sorry when I reached the end."<br>--Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun</p><h2>Pastoral</h2><p><p><i>There were plans for an official welcome. It was to take place the following Sunday. But those who came to the rectory on Father Pennant's second day were the ones who could not resist seeing him sooner.

But in the blink of an eye -- and the sneeze of a nose -- Melvin goes from snooty to snotty, and the Bionic Booger Boy is born! Can Captain Underpants clean up this catastrophe, or will the mucous monster make a mess of things?</p><p>The sixth "epic novel" in Dav Pilkey's hugely popular series explains the awful truth about Captain Underpants (he is really the school principal), details "the night of the nasty nostril nuggets," offers up "the unnecessarily disgusting chapter," and even explains how "you can't have your cape and Edith, too." <p> George and Harold are "C" students (and bad spellers), but they are very good at "saving the entire planet from the nasty forces of unrelenting evil" and also at ketchup-toilet pranks. Unfortunately, they can't save Melvin Sneedly from getting paddled by his bionic hamster. But, frankly, they wouldn't want to, because besides being the school brainiac, Melvin is also a tattletale. When his robot-making hobby backfires horribly, Melvin transforms himself into the Bionic Booger Boy instead of a bionic superboy. Can Captain Underpants save everyone from this "greenish, glistening behemoth?"</p><p> Pilkey is the superhero of boy humor, stuffing his heavily illustrated books with comic-book inserts, "flip-o-rama" animation, and all the gross-out jokes an elementary-school kid could stomach. Fans will want to get their hands on <i>Captain Underpants and the Big Bad Battle of the Bionic Booger Boy Part 2: The Revenge of the Ridiculous Robo-Boogers</i> as well.

McLimans has created a black-and-white iconic representation of 26 endangered animals, and his art is striking. For example, the newt's eyes protrude slightly from the sides of N, while its tongue emerges from the lower point. An accompanying box on each page includes a small, stylized red-and-white image of the animal plus information about its class, habitat, range, and threats to its survival. Back matter includes a paragraph about each creature along with a list of Web sites for organizations that help endangered animals and books for further reading. This title will serve more as a tool to raise awareness and a place to begin searching for information rather than as a source of facts. However, the arresting graphics and clean design will hold viewers' attention and create interest in the topic. The book could also serve as a starting point for art and design projects for students well above elementary school age.<i>&#x2013;Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State University, Mankato</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A memoir of his boyhood in Oklahoma and the Southwest, it is also described by Momaday as "an act of the imagination.

A popular speaker, he narrated the PBS series <i>The West</i>."It is a search and a celebration, a book of identities and sources....Out of ordinary materials&#x2014;genealogy, tribal tales, memories of a boyhood spent in Oklahoma, at Ship Rock in the Navajo country and at the Jemez pueblo, where his parents taught school&#x2014;he has built a mystical, provocative book." &#x2014;Wallace Stegner, <i>New York Times</i><br><br> "A Native American version of <i>Roots</i> . . . full of the sense of wonder that characterizes classic American literature." &#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br><br> "Graceful, lucid prose...[Momaday] is forever an Indian and the reader understands why." &#x2014;<i>Atlantic Monthly</i><br><br> "With the eye of a painter and the voice of a poet, Momaday vividly recreates a childhood world of color, sound, and experience played out against the backdrop of tribal tales and in the shadow of revered forebears. . . .

Bolender allows the victims to articulate the atrocities the Cuban people have suffered - which largely originate from Cuban counter-revolutionaries based in the US, often with the active help of the CIA.<br><br><i>Voices From The Other Side</i> includes first-person interviews with more than 75 Cuban citizens who have been victims of these terrorist acts, or have had family members or close friends die from the attacks.

She called him Doctor Bright, one of his many names and as false as all the rest.</p><p>&#x201c;Doctor Bright,&#x201d; she said after sipping the tea he always provided, &#x201c;I had a terrible argument with my brother this afternoon. It was my fault&#x2014;I missed an important appointment with the lawyers regarding the estate. I just forgot. I was distracted, knowing I&#x2019;d be coming here, and I forgot. Marcus was so upset and impatient with me. He doesn&#x2019;t understand, Doctor Bright. If I could just explain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Bright lifted his dark, dramatic eyebrows. &#x201c;What did your father say, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He said it wasn&#x2019;t time.&#x201d; She leaned forward, all that hope and faith (and how tedious that had become) glowing on her face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so anxious to talk to him and Mama again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you will, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>He sipped his tea, smiled at her. &#x201c;Drink your tea.

And he wanted to whack her with a hammer.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to meet Henry tonight,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;He wants to set the date, and that&#x2019;s something else I want to talk to Mama and Daddy about. They were so pleased when Henry and I got engaged. And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Transitions, a journey.&#x201d; He played his fingers in the air as he spoke, watched her watch them dance. &#x201c;Nothing more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I know that now. It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I want to share this with Marcus, and with Henry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I promised you, and my father.

Coming here, all I&#x2019;ve learned, it&#x2019;s shown me there aren&#x2019;t any ends, just other paths. Before I came to you, everything seemed so dark, so final. And now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>She beamed at him, her eyes wide and bright, and just going glassy. &#x201c;I can never repay you for all you&#x2019;ve given me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my gift to give. Regrettably, at a price.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, of course.&#x201d; She laughed&#x2014;giddy, yes giddy, primed by his tea party. Opening her bag, she took out a thick red envelope.</p><p>Always red for Ms. Fitzwilliams, with cash (he only took cash) in the amount of nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars sealed inside. He&#x2019;d told her red protected the offering, and nine was a number of power.</p><p>In truth red was his current favorite color (though it was about to be supplanted by purple), and he found all those nines amusing.</p><p>Darlene set it, as she&#x2019;d been instructed, on the silver tray on the tea table.</p><p>&#x201c;And the tokens?&#x201d; he prompted. He wouldn&#x2019;t touch or count the money. The lovely Ms. March would see to all that. But when the biddable girl took two red pouches from her bag, Bright&#x2019;s fingers itched.</p><p>These he took, these he touched, these he stroked.</p><p>The desk clock was old, heavy crystal, small enough to fit in the palm of his hand. Its monetary value Bright estimated in the low thousands, but it was worth so much more to him.</p><p>He could feel Gareth Fitzwilliams&#x2019;s energy shimmering on it, and his father&#x2019;s before him, and yes, even generations back. So many hands touching, so many eyes marking time.</p><p>He opened the second pouch, took out the slim, antique ladies&#x2019; watch. A tiny diamond butterfly perched above the twelve, and pretty diamond chips circled the face.</p><p>Yes, Bria Fitzwilliams had worn it often, choosing it in lieu of more stylish and practical wrist units, clasping it on thinking of her own mother, her mother&#x2019;s mother, and back five generations.</p><p>Time marked again, birth to death, death to birth and round and round.</p><p>&#x201c;You chose well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re favorites.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Strong energy. Strong connections. Are you ready?&#x201d;</p><p>He slipped each pouch in a pocket so he could take her hand, lead her from the room. He could feel the vibrations&#x2014;excitement, fear? Wasn&#x2019;t it all too delicious?</p><p>He led her up stairs he liked for their zigzagging climb, down a corridor he enjoyed as the paint and wainscoting he&#x2019;d designed gave it the illusion of a slant.</p><p>The girl weaved like a drunk, so he had to stifle a quick giggle.</p><p>He took her into what he called the Passage Room, where lights glowed blue. She took her seat&#x2014;a good girl&#x2014;in the high-backed armchair on the raised platform. The height would keep their eyes level, an essential element to what came next.</p><p>&#x201c;Breathe deep,&#x201d; he told her as a blue mist swirled around the chair. &#x201c;Slow and deep. Hear my voice.&#x201d;</p><p>Behind him a white spiral formed on the wall, began to spin. Lights flashed, strobing colors.</p><p>&#x201c;Open your mind.&#x201d;</p><p>A hat seemed to float down, to settle on Darlene&#x2019;s head, its long, red feathers swaying. For a moment it banded tight around her skull, caused discomfort, then that eased, and colors washed the room. She smelled flowers, and her mother&#x2019;s perfume.</p><p>&#x201c;Mama.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A moment more.&#x201d; Pleased with her quick response, he stepped over to a cupboard, opened it, and chose a hat for himself out of the dozens stored there.</p><p>A top hat in bold red, for young Ms. Fitzwilliams.</p><p>&#x201c;Into my eyes, into my voice. Follow both to the threshold.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes were glass, pinned to his. Helpless, he thought, and this time he did giggle.</p><p>He slipped into her mind&#x2014;so easy now, like sliding on ice&#x2014;and saw as she saw.</p><p>A sun-drenched meadow under perfect blue skies. Birds twittered; a warm breeze fluttered the flowers spread everywhere over the ground.</p><p>There, under a tall tree spreading dappled shade on a pretty slope, stood Gareth and Bria Fitzwilliams. Young, smiling, he handsome in his white suit, she lovely in her flowing white dress.</p><p>With a happy cry, Darlene ran to her dead parents and embraced them.</p><p>Touching, Bright thought, so very touching. He dabbed a mock tear from the corner of his eye and gave her nearly twenty minutes to walk in the meadow.</p><p>It was never enough, of course, and she was protesting, reaching out, when the blue mist swirled over the flowers. But it was all he could spare her this time&#x2014;this last time.</p><p>He gave her instructions, made her repeat them twice before he removed her hat, and his own. He led her downstairs where the inestimable Ms. March had her coat and bag&#x2014;and what was now inside it&#x2014;waiting.</p><p>He helped her on with her coat himself, checked to be sure the recorder was properly affixed. After all his time and effort, he deserved to join the farewell party.</p><p>&#x201c;Once you&#x2019;re in the car, driving away, you won&#x2019;t remember me or this house or anything we&#x2019;ve talked about. You&#x2019;ll remember your parents, of course, and all you spoke of with them.&#x201d; He kissed her hand, gallantly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a pleasure, my dear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Doctor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And where are you going now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To see my brother. We argued. I need to tell him everything and give him a gift.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s excellent. Good-bye, Ms. Fitzwilliams.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good-bye, Doctor Bright.&#x201d;</p><p>She walked out and to the curb, where his own driver held open the door of his town car. He waved her cheerily off, stepped back, shut the door.</p><p>And laughing like a loon, did a jig around the foyer.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, was that too, too precious?&#x201d;</p><p>He grabbed March&#x2019;s hands, and kicking off her practical black heels, she joined him in the dance. Giggling with him, she pulled the pins out of her sensible bun so her long, brown hair tumbled and swirled.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s party time, Bright!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s always party time, March!&#x201d;</p><p>They clutched each other, swaying as they caught their breath. &#x201c;A surprise party,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and we mustn&#x2019;t be late. To the theater, March, and don&#x2019;t spare the popcorn!&#x201d;</p><p>They raced off together to watch the show.</p><p>In the car, Darlene felt energized, almost euphoric. The lights of the city glittered like ice. She was warm, almost too warm, in the car, and reached for the tall, slim glass of clear liquid marked <i>Drink Me</i>.</p><p>Cool and light on the tongue, it made her smile.</p><p>She was going to see Marcus. They&#x2019;d argued earlier, she could hardly remember why. But the why didn&#x2019;t matter. They would make up, and she&#x2019;d tell him about the dreams she&#x2019;d been having. Dreams of their parents, and how they&#x2019;d helped her accept their sudden, tragic deaths.</p><p>They were together, away from all pain, all worry, all sorrow.</p><p>She felt the same, right at that moment. She should contact Henry, tell him she&#x2019;d bring Marcus with her. They&#x2019;d set the date for the wedding.</p><p>But when she started to reach for her &#x2019;link, a pain shot up her arm.</p><p>Because she wasn&#x2019;t supposed to do that, she remembered. She wasn&#x2019;t supposed to talk to Henry yet. Marcus. She was supposed to see Marcus.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t complain when the car pulled over a block from Marcus&#x2019;s building, but got out, began to walk. The frigid January wind whistled around her ears. It was almost like voices.</p><p>A new year, she reminded herself as headlights beamed into her eyes. The year she&#x2019;d marry Henry Boyle: 2061.</p><p>Her parents had died in June of 2060. She wanted them at her wedding. She&#x2019;d dream them there, she decided. She&#x2019;d explain it all to Henry&#x2014;no, Marcus; Marcus first. And they&#x2019;d all be happy again.</p><p>&#x201c;Evening, Miss Fitzwilliams.&#x201d;</p><p>She stared at the doorman. He wore a big red heart over his chest and was gobbling what seemed to be a cherry tart.</p><p>Then she blinked, and it was just Philip the night doorman in his thick navy coat.</p><p>&#x201c;You okay, miss?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, yes. Sorry. My mind went somewhere. I&#x2019;m going up to see my brother.&#x201d;</p><p>He opened the door for her and, God, the lobby looked so long, so narrow, so bright. &#x201c;Is he alone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As far as I know. He came in a couple hours ago. Want me to call up for you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d; The elevator doors looked so shiny. She could see worlds reflected in them. She stepped in, had to think very hard to remember. &#x201c;Fifty-two east.&#x201d;</p><p>The ride up made her feel a little drunk. She needed something to eat, she decided. Had she had dinner? Odd that she couldn&#x2019;t remember.</p><p>A couple got in as she got out, called her by name.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh hello.&#x201d; She smiled at them, the man with the grinning cat&#x2019;s face and the woman wearing a crown. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to see Marcus. I have something for him.&#x201d;</p><p>She rang the bell on her brother&#x2019;s door, waited with a smile until he opened it.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Just as she knew he was still angry with her. She held out a hand for his. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, Marcus.&#x201d;</p><p>He sighed, shook his head. Closed the door behind her. &#x201c;I miss them, too, Darli, and we owe it to them to make sure everything&#x2019;s done right, for the estate, for the business, for the rest of the family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t keep closing in, shutting down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. I know. It&#x2019;s been so hard, Marcus, losing them the way we did, and I haven&#x2019;t handled it well. I haven&#x2019;t done my share.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about the work,&#x201d; he began, then his eyes narrowed on her face. &#x201c;Have you been drinking?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? No!&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;Just tea, lots of tea, and I&#x2019;ve got so much to tell you. I needed to talk to them first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mama and Daddy, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Darlene.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I needed to <i>know</i> they&#x2019;re all right. In a better place. I can <i>see</i> them there, and it&#x2019;s beautiful. It&#x2019;s Wonderland!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; He set a hand on her shoulder. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I brought you something, like a peace offering.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine. Take off your coat, let&#x2019;s sit down. We need to talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In a minute,&#x201d; she muttered. She opened her bag, stared at the red scarf. Her fingers floated over it, through it, and down to the bright red rose beneath.</p><p>&#x201c;For you,&#x201d; she said and pushed it at him. In him.</p><p>He looked at her so strangely, but then he wasn&#x2019;t the sort of man who expected a flower. Delighted, she pulled it back, pushed it at him again.</p><p>And again, until he sprawled in the meadow covered with red roses.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get Mama and Daddy now, so you can talk to them. Sit right there!&#x201d; She raced across the meadow, pushed past long, flowering vines that barred the view. And climbed to the top of the hill.</p><p>She saw her parents dancing by a silver lake and, laughing, flew toward them.</p><p>And flying, never felt the fall.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Instead of enjoying a rare night off sprawled out with her ridiculously sexy husband watching a vid where lots of stuff blew up, Eve Dallas stood over death.</p><p>She&#x2019;d pulled rank&#x2014;a favor for a friend&#x2014;to take primary on what, on the surface, struck as a murder/suicide.

In <i>The New Yorker, </i>his writings are such must-reads that the magazine charges advertisers significantly more money for ads that run within his articles. With his #1 bestsellers, <i>The Tipping Point</i>, <i>Blink</i> and<i> Outliers</i>, he has reached millions of readers. And now the very best and most famous of his <i>New Yorker </i>pieces are collected in a brilliant and provocative anthology. Among the pieces: his investigation into why there are so many different kinds of mustard but only one kind of ketchup; a surprising assessment of what makes for a safer automobile; a look at how we hire when we can't tell who's right for the job; an examination of machine built to predict hit movies; the reasons why homelessness might be easier to solve than manage; his famous profile of inventor and entrepreneur Ron Popeil; a look at why employers love personality tests; a dissection of Ivy League admissions and who gets in; the saga of the quest to invent the perfect cookie; and a look at hair dye and the hidden history of postwar America.<br><br>For the millions of Malcolm Gladwell fans, this anthology is like a greatest hits compilation-a mix tape from America's alpha mind</p><p>Malcolm Gladwell is a staff writer for <em>The New Yorker</em>. He was formerly a business and science reporter at the <em>Washington Post</em>.Ranging in subject from master salesman Ron Popeil to hair dye, pasta sauce, and how the NFL can help us hire better teachers, this collection of the author&#39;s essays from THE NEW YORKER is both entertaining and informative. Malcolm Gladwell reminds us that authors can effectively read their own books by turning in a well-crafted, subtle performance. His slightly husky upper-register voice is calm and assured, and he knows exactly where to pause, provide emphasis, and how to deliver a punch line. While Gladwell is not a seasoned reader and sometimes needs to vary his pitch and rhythm, he seems to relish bringing to light the ideas and people he finds fascinating.

Bring up that kick. Mmm-hmm. Better.&#x201d; I kicked again, this time higher, trying to remember to point my toes, squeeze my core, and flutter my fingers in the &#x201c;jazz hands&#x201d; our instructor ceaselessly demanded.</p><p>Next to me, and considerably less enthused, my best friend and soon-to-be-ex-roommate, Mallory, growled and executed another kick. The growl was an odd accompaniment to the bob of blue hair and classically pretty face, but she was irritated enough to carry it off.</p><p>&#x201c;Remind me why you dragged me into this?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>Our instructor, a busty blonde with bright pink nails and impossibly sharp cheekbones, clapped her hands together. Her breasts joggled in syncopation. It was impossible to look away.</p><p>&#x201c;Fiercer, ladies! We want every eye in the club on our bodies! Let&#x2019;s <i>work</i> it!&#x201d;</p><p>Mallory glared daggers at the instructor we&#x2019;d named Aerobics Barbie. Mal&#x2019;s fists curled and she took a menacing step forward, but I wrapped an arm around her waist before she could pummel the woman we&#x2019;d paid to grapevine us into skinny jeans.</p><p>&#x201c;Ixnay on the ighting-fay,&#x201d; I warned, using a little of my two-month-old vampire strength to keep her in place despite her bobbing fists. Mallory grumbled, but finally stopped struggling.</p><p>Score one for the newbie vampire, I thought.</p><p>&#x201c;How about a little civilized beat-down?&#x201d; she asked, blowing a lock of sweaty blue hair from her forehead.</p><p>I shook my head, but let her go. &#x201c;Beating down the teacher&#x2019;s gonna get you more attention than you need, Mal. Remember what Catcher said.&#x201d;</p><p>Catcher was Mallory&#x2019;s gruff boyfriend. And while my comment didn&#x2019;t merit a growl, I got a nasty, narrow-eyed snarl. Catcher loved Mallory, and Mallory loved Catcher. But that didn&#x2019;t mean she liked him all the time, especially since she was dealing with a supernatural perfect storm centered over our Chicago brownstone. In the span of a week, I&#x2019;d been unwillingly made a vampire, and we&#x2019;d learned that Mallory was a still-developing sorceress. As in, magical powers, black cats and the major and minor Keys&#x2014;the divisions of magic.</p><p>So, yeah. My first few weeks as a vampire had been inordinately busy. Like <i>The Young and the Restless</i>, but with slightly dead people.</p><p>Mal was still getting used to the idea that she had paranormal drama of her own, and Catcher, already in trouble with the Order (the sorcerers&#x2019; governing union), was keeping a pretty tight lid on her magical demonstrations. So Mallory was supernaturally frustrated.</p><p>Hell, we were both supernaturally frustrated, and Mallory didn&#x2019;t have fangs or a pretentious Master vampire to deal with.</p><p>So, given that unfortunate state of affairs, why were we letting Aerobics Barbie guilt us into using jazz hands?</p><p>Simply put, this was supposed to be quality time, bonding time, for me and Mallory.</p><p>Because I was moving out.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Barbie continued, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s add that combination we learned last week. One, two and three and four, and five, six and seven and eight.&#x201d; The music reached a pounding crescendo as she pivoted and thrusted to the bass-heavy beat. We followed as best we could, Mallory having a little harder time of not stepping on her own feet. My years of ballet classes&#x2014;and the quick-step speed that vampirism gave me&#x2014;were actually serving me pretty well, the humiliation of a twenty-eight-year-old vampire doing jazz hands notwithstanding.</p><p>Barbie&#x2019;s enthusiasm aside, the fact that we were doing jazz hands in a hip-hop dance class didn&#x2019;t say much for her credentials. But the class was still an improvement over my usual training. My workouts were usually <i>tr�s</i> intense, because only a couple of months ago I&#x2019;d been named Sentinel for my House.</p><p>To make a long story slightly shorter, American vampires were divided into Houses. Chicago had three, and I&#x2019;d been initiated into the second oldest of those&#x2014;Cadogan. Much to everyone&#x2019;s surprise given my background (think grad school and medieval romantic literature), I&#x2019;d been named Sentinel. Although I was still learning the ropes, being Sentinel meant I was supposed to act as a kind of vampire guard. (Turns out that while I was a pretty geeky human, I was a pretty strong vampire.) Being Sentinel also meant training, and while American vampires had traded in the black velvet and lace for Armani and iPhones, they were pretty old school on a lot of issues&#x2014;feudal on a lot of issues&#x2014;including weapons. Put all that together, and it meant I was learning to wield the antique katana I&#x2019;d been given to defend Cadogan and its vampires.</p><p>Coincidentally enough, Catcher was an expert in the Second of the Four Keys&#x2014;weapons&#x2014;so he&#x2019;d been tasked with prepping me for vampire combat. As a newbie vampire, having Catcher as a sparring partner wasn&#x2019;t exactly great for the confidence.</p><p>Aerobics Barbie whipped herself into a hip-hop frenzy, leading the class in a final multistep combination that ended with the lot of us staring sassily at the mirrors that lined the dance studio. Session concluded, she applauded and made some announcements about future classes that Mallory and I would have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to attend.</p><p>&#x201c;Never again, Merit,&#x201d; she said, walking to the corner of the room where she&#x2019;d deposited her bag and water bottle before class started. I couldn&#x2019;t have agreed more. Although I loved to dance, hip thrusting under Barbie&#x2019;s bubbly instruction and ever-bouncing bosom involved too little actual dance and too much cleavage. I needed to respect my dance master. Respect wasn&#x2019;t exactly the emotion Barbie inspired.</p><p>We sat down on the floor to prep for our return to the real world.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Ms. Vampire,&#x201d; Mallory asked me, &#x201c;are you nervous about moving into the House?&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced around, not entirely sure how much chatting I should be doing about my vampire business. The Chicagoland Vampires had announced their existence to Chicago roughly ten months ago, and as you might guess, humans weren&#x2019;t thrilled to learn that we existed. Riots. Panic. Congressional investigations. And then Chicago&#x2019;s three Houses became wrapped up in the investigation of two murders&#x2014;murders supposedly perpetrated by vampires from Cadogan and Grey, the youngest Chicago House. The Masters of those Houses, Ethan Sullivan and Scott Grey, dreaded the attention.</p><p>But the Master of the third House (that was Navarre) was conniving, manipulative, and the one that actually planned the murders. She was also drop-dead gorgeous, no pun intended. She might as well have leaped from an editorial spread in <i>Vogue</i>. Dark hair and blue eyes (just like me), but with an arrogance that put celebrities and cult leaders to shame.</p><p>Humans were entranced, <i>fascinated</i>, by Celina Desaulniers.</p><p>Her beauty, her style, and her ability to psychically manipulate those around her were an irresistible combination. Humans wanted to learn more about her, to see more, to hear more.</p><p>That she&#x2019;d been responsible for the deaths of two humans&#x2014;murders she&#x2019;d planned and confessed to&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t minimized their fascination. Nor had the fact that she&#x2019;d been captured (BTW, by Ethan and me) and extradited to London for incarceration by the Greenwich Presidium, the council that ruled Western European and North American vampires. And in her place, the rest of us&#x2014;the exonerated majority who hadn&#x2019;t helped her commit those heinous crimes&#x2014;became that much more interesting. Celina got her wish&#x2014;she got to play the bad little martyred vampire&#x2014;and we got an early Christmas present: We got to step into the vacuum of her celebrity.</p><p>T-shirts, caps, and pennants for Grey and Cadogan (and for the more morbid, Navarre) were available for sale in shops around Chicago. There were House fan sites, &#x201c;I &#x2665; Cadogan&#x201d; bumper stickers, and news updates on the city&#x2019;s vampires.</p><p>Still, notorious or not, I tried not to spread too many deets about the Houses around town.

Christiansen isolated some seventy-seven legend types, and many of these are represented here in absorbing stories of St. Olaf, hidden treasures, witches, and spirits of the air, water, and earth. The ugly, massively strong, but slow-witted trolls are familiar to English-speaking readers. Less well-known, but the subject of an enormous number of legends, are the more manlike yet sinister &#34;huldre-folk&#34; who live in houses and try to woo human girls. These tales reflect the wildness of Norway, its mountains, forests, lakes, and sea, and the stalwart character of its sparse population. &#34;The translation is excellent, retaining the traditional Norwegian style . . . the tales themselves will also appeal to the interested layman&#34;. -Library Journal</p><p></p><h2>The Sagan Conspiracy: NASA&#x2019;s Untold Plot to Suppress The People&#x2019;s Scientist&#x2019;s Theory of Ancient Aliens</h2><p>Mainstream SETI scientists and ancient alien theorists don't agree on much, but one opinion they share is that the undisputed authority on the possibility of alien existence was the late Carl Sagan (1934--1996), whose voluminous writings on the subject have had a profound influence on ETI research.<br><br>But how many Carl Sagan fans know that while the renowned scientist was at Stanford University, he produced a controversial paper, funded by a NASA research grant, that concludes ancient alien intervention may have sparked human civilization? Author Donald Zygutis lays out a compelling case that points to a cover-up by the Pentagon and NASA, who may have buried it soon after it was written. How significant is the Stanford Paper? The answer may lie in another question: How would a science-backed theory and search strategy to guide the discovery of alien artifacts among our own ancient civilizations impact the worldwide institutions of government, religion, and culture?<br><br>Recently rediscovered by the author, Sagan's lost Stanford paper is the central theme of <i>The Sagan Conspiracy</i>. Groundbreaking research and paradigm-changing material challenges conventional thinking about the People's Scientist--and maybe even the origins of human society. Sagan even conceived of the likelihood that the ancient Sumerian civilization had been visited and influenced by beings from other worlds as evidenced by ancient manuscripts, among other artifacts.<br><br>As we celebrate the 20-year anniversary of Carl's death, <i>The Sagan Conspiracy</i> is sure to fundamentally alter how the world thinks about extraterrestrials.</p><p>Donald L.

But, for a large part, this information focusses on modern cutting tests and only briefly discusses the historical aspect. As far as sword collectors are concerned, the subject of tameshigiri has been approached by several experts in the past, but here too information is rather limited. This publication systematically processes this subject for the first time to provide an overview of the historical aspect of tameshigiri. Not only are the developments from mere sword tests to systematic cutting tests are addressed, it also explains the sword testers, the various cuts and set-ups for cuts, and the practice of recording cutting test results on sword tangs for example.

Through Jean M. Auel&#x2019;s magnificent storytelling we are taken back to the dawn of modern humans, and with a girl named Ayla we are swept up in the harsh and beautiful Ice Age world they shared with the ones who called themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear.</p><p>A natural disaster leaves the young girl wandering alone in an unfamiliar and dangerous land until she is found by a woman of the Clan, people very different from her own kind. To them, blonde, blue-eyed Ayla looks peculiar and ugly&#x2014;she is one of the Others, those who have moved into their ancient homeland; but Iza cannot leave the girl to die and takes her with them.</p><p>Iza and Creb, the old Mog-ur, grow to love her, and as Ayla learns the ways of the Clan and Iza&#x2019;s way of healing, most come to accept her. But the brutal and proud youth who is destined to become their next leader sees her differences as a threat to his authority. He develops a deep and abiding hatred for the strange girl of the Others who lives in their midst, and is determined to get his revenge.</p><p><b>First in the acclaimed Earth&#x2019;s Children� series</b></p></p><p>When her parents are killed by an earthquake, 5-year-old Ayla wanders through the forest completely alone. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, the little girl is as good as gone until she is discovered by a group who call themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the "Others." Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. She painstakingly nurses her back to health--a decision that will forever alter the physical and emotional structure of the clan. Although this story takes place roughly 35,000 years ago, its cast of characters could easily slide into any modern tale. The members of the Neanderthal clan, ruled by traditions and taboos, find themselves challenged by this outsider, who represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.<p> Although Jean Auel obviously takes certain liberties with the actions and motivations of all our ancestors, her extensive research into the Ice Age does shine through--especially in the detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla. Mostly, though, this first in the series of four is a wonderful story of survival. Ayla's personal evolution is a compelling and relevant tale. <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p>The stunning epic that stirred the imagination of millions. Here is a novel of awesome beauty and power.

Through Jean Auel&#39;s magnificent storytelling, we are taken back to the dawn of mankind and swept up in the wonderful world of a very special heroine, Ayla.

She is currently President of the Michigan Dietetic Association, and her experience as a practitioner includes clinical nutrition, clinical management, and community nutrition. </p><p> Introduction </p><p> The meaning of the word "superfood" has evolved over time and taken on specific connotations in different parts of the world. According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary (OED)</i>, the term dates back to two early usages in print media in 1915 and 1949. The <i>OED</i> entry provides an adequate general definition: "food considered especially nutritious or otherwise beneficial to health and well-being." In recent years, however, some more specific definitions have had to be created, partly to protect consumers against unscrupulous marketing practices. </p><p> A concept that has been widely employed to help better define the meaning of "superfood" is that of the "nutrient density" of foods, whereby foods are described as either "nutrient-dense" (or "nutrient-rich") or "nutrient-poor." The so-called essential nutrients are compounds that we need to grow and maintain our bodies and can only obtain from food; they include protein, carbohydrates, fat, minerals, and vitamins. A nutrient-dense or nutrient-rich food is one that provides significant levels of these nutrients <i>in a reasonable number of calories</i>. A useful way to get to grips with this concept is to think of your optimal daily calorie level, a level that does not promote weight gain, as money. When we buy things, we all want to get the best product for our dollars; likewise, we have a limited number of calories that we can use each day, so we want to obtain the highest possible levels of essential nutrients for those limited calories. </p><p> And it's certainly true that many superfoods are nutrient-rich foods--dark, leafy vegetables, for example, are high in vitamin A and other essential nutrients, and low in calories. But superfoods also include foods that are high in other compounds that are not essential nutrients but may still offer health benefits--most notably, the compounds collectively known as phytochemicals. </p><p> According to current scientific understanding, the potential benefits of eating foods that are high in either nutrients or phytochemicals, or both, include the fact that they may help lower our risk of developing certain chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. In the majority of Western countries, these are the leading causes of death. So, by incorporating the foods in this book into your eating plan, you might well increase your likelihood of living longer. </p></p><h2>The Winged Energy of Delight: Selected Translations</h2><p><p>Robert Bly has always been amazingly prescient in his choice of poets to translate.

For two decades,&nbsp;Stuart McLean travelled across the country every December with The Vinyl Cafe Christmas tour, bringing the gift of laughter and light during the darkest days of the year. The hilarious world of Dave and Morley was even more real&#x2014;more vibrant&#x2014;during the holidays. For many, the Vinyl Cafe Christmas stories became beloved family traditions. Now, for the first time, they have been brought together in this special collection&#x2014;including the classic "Dave Cooks the Turkey," as well as five new, never before published Christmas stories. From mishaps with the Turlingtons and the tale of a young Dave's first holiday disaster to the surprising "Christmas Ferret" and the touching sign off in "The Christmas Card," these wonderful new stories will delight for years to come. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brimming with charm and humour (often at Dave's expense), these twelve stories entertain on every page, reminding us what the holidays are all about.</p><p>STUART McLEAN was the writer and host of the popular CBC Radio show <i>The Vinyl Cafe</i>.

Traditions that bring warmth and light to the cold, dark days of December.<br><br>The smell of the fir tree when you walk into the house.<br><br>The crackle of the fire.<br><br>Eggnog and mulled wine.<br><br>A mountain of presents under the tree.<br><br>Or that moment on Christmas Eve, just before bed, when everyone is asleep except you. The house is dark, but for the glow of the lights on the tree. And you sit there, in the halo, and finish your cup of tea (or, okay, your Scotch) and enjoy one peaceful moment before the madness of the morning ahead.<br><br>Even families that don&#x2019;t celebrate Christmas often have Christmas traditions: Chinese food on Christmas&nbsp;Eve, going to the movies on Christmas Day, or heading south to avoid the entire thing altogether.<br><br>Most of us mark the season in some fashion or another.<br><br>It was no different for Stuart and our little Vinyl Cafe family. For years, for decades, we celebrated the season inour own merry way. But it wasn&#x2019;t always like that.<br><br>It started the year Dave cooked the family turkey. Or,more to the point, when he didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>That was the very first Vinyl Cafe Christmas story,and the story that turned Christmas into a deal for ushere at the Vinyl Cafe.<br><br>After that first performance of &#x201c;Dave Cooks the Turkey&#x201d; in 1996, we realized that Butch, in his quirky Grade B way, had changed the Vinyl Cafe landscape. The reaction was so intense it <i>had</i> to be followed with another Christmas story. So, every year, around October, Stuart would begin to imagine how Dave and his family might tackle the holidays, always mindful that every scenario would be measured against <i>the turkey</i>.<br><br>Over the years, the turkey story became like a snowball rolling down a snow-covered hill. It just kept getting. . . bigger. People wrote to tell us that the story had become one of their Christmas traditions. Some spent Christmas Eve sitting together as a family, listening to the turkey story on CD. Some read it out loud as part of their holiday celebration. Others felt the season didn&#x2019;t start until they heard Stuart read it on the radio. <br><br>As the turkey story became one of <i>your</i> traditions, you became one of<i> our </i>Christmas traditions. Slowly, over the next twenty-one years, our annual Christmas concert grew from just one Christmas show at Glenn Gould Studio at the CBC in Toronto to a thirty-six-show national tour.<br><br>We loved that tour. The Christmas concerts felt like a family reunion. Stuart used to say it was more like sitting around a living room than an auditorium.<br><br>We would spend five weeks chugging around the country, crammed into a tour bus with a wonderful extended family: musicians, lighting and sound engineers, editors, producers, tour managers, and bus drivers. Then, in every city and town, we&#x2019;d gather with not only the people on the bus and the people who worked on the radio show but also their families. And the audience. Over the years, many of you made our Christmas concert one of your family traditions. We started to recognize your faces out in the lobby. We got to know you, and you got to know us.<br><br>Like so many things at this time of year, the Christmas tour had a magical quality. We&#x2019;d often walk back to the hotel after the concert, the celebratory feeling of the show hanging around like our warm breath in the cold air.<br><br>At the hotel, we&#x2019;d gather at the bar and rehash our favourite moments from the show: the hambone kid who joined Stuart on stage, the singalong finale, the surprising laugh in the story that we hadn&#x2019;t been expecting. Each show felt familiar, but also exciting and new.

Although most of these accounts appeared before the Civil War, more than one-third are the result of the ambitious efforts of the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to interview surviving ex-slaves during the 1930s. The result of these efforts was the Slave Narrative Collection, a group of autobiographical accounts of former slaves that today stands as one of the most enduring and noteworthy achievements of the WPA. Compiled in seventeen states during the years 1936-38, the collection consists of more than two thousand interviews with former slaves, most of them first-person accounts of slave life and the respondents' own reactions to bondage. The interviews afforded aged ex-slaves an unparalleled opportunity to give their personal accounts of life under the "peculiar institution," to describe in their own words what it felt like to be a slave in the United States.<br>&#x2015;Norman R.

As we reach the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, nearly half the Catholic population is Hispanic and it is estimated that by 2050 Latinos/as will constitute the vast majority of U.S. Catholics. Hispanic Catholics as a group bring abundant gifts to the Church in the United States yet together face many challenges.As the century unfolds, the achievements and struggles of Hispanic Catholics will be undoubtedly perceived as those of the whole Church in the U.S. Hosffman Ospino brings an edited collection of essays written by leading voices in the field of ministry and theology that explore the present and future of Catholic Hispanic Ministry. The essays were crafted as study documents for a national symposium on this topic and were edited for further reflection in ministerial and academic contexts. This Book offers an important contribution to understand the future character of Catholicism in the U.S.</p><p>&#34;This bilingual volume is quite thorough in its treatment of the history, challenges, and future of Hispanic ministry in the United States. Such important issues as engaging youth and young adults, socio-economic realities, discrimination, the missionary status of the Catholic Church, and social compassion for the poor and alienated are examined with great care and research. For anyone involved in ministerial leadership and education, this resource presents a fine dialogue for ministers and the faithful.&#34; - Arthur Quinn, St. Vincent De Paul Regional Seminary<b>Hosffman Ospino</b>, born in Colombia and currently living in the United States, teaches pastoral theology and religious education at Boston College where he is the director of the university s graduate programs in Hispanic Ministry.

Before<i>Sex and the City</i> and ViagraTM, America relied on Masters and Johnson to teach us everything we needed to know about what goes on in the bedroom. Convincing hundreds of men and women to shed their clothes and copulate, the pair were the nation&#x2019;s top experts on love and intimacy. Highlighting interviews with the notoriously private Masters and the ambitious Johnson, critically acclaimed biographer Thomas Maier shows how this unusual team changed the way we all thought about, talked about, and engaged in sex while they simultaneously tried to make sense of their own relationship. Entertaining, revealing, and beautifully told,<i>Masters of Sex</i> sheds light on the eternal mysteries of desire, intimacy, and the American psyche.<br></p><p><b>Thomas Maier</b> is the author of the critically acclaimed <i>Dr. Spock: An American Life</i>, which was a<i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year; <i>The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings</i>, which was adapted into a Warner Home Video documentary; and<i>Newhouse</i>, which won the Frank Luther Mott Award for Best Media Book. An award-winning investigative journalist at<i>Newsday</i>, he lives with his wife and three sons in Long Island, New York.<br>Dorie Barton provides listeners with great direction and emphasis as she recounts the lives of the twentieth century&#39;s most well-known sex pioneers. Maier crafts an honest and intricate account of William Masters and Virgina Johnson, revealing how their personal relationships (including with each other) came to play a role in their professional lives as well. Barton complements Maier&#39;s writing style, taking on two distinct voices to represent the different viewpoints and lives of Masters and Johnson. Some elements that Maier includes may initially seem superfluous, but in the end, they prove essential for understanding these two iconic scientists.

In this distinctive book, Sarah Imhoff shows that the project of shaping American Jewish manhood was not just one of assimilation or exclusion. Jewish manhood was neither a mirror of normative American manhood nor its negative, effeminate opposite. Imhoff demonstrates how early 20th-century Jews constructed a gentler, less aggressive manhood, drawn partly from the American pioneer spirit and immigration experience, but also from Hollywood and the YMCA, which required intense cultivation of a muscled male physique. She contends that these models helped Jews articulate the value of an acculturated American Judaism. Tapping into a rich historical literature to reveal how Jews looked at masculinity differently than Protestants or other religious groups, Imhoff illuminates the particular experience of American Jewish men.</p></p><p><p>Sarah Imhoff is Assistant Professor in the Department of&nbsp;Religious Studies and the Borns Jewish Studies Program at&nbsp;Indiana University. Her research focuses on religion and the body, including work on gender and American Judaism both historically and in the present, the role of DNA and genetic discourse in constructions of Jewishness, and the history of the field of religious studies.</p><p>"Invariably lucid and engaging, Sarah Imhoff provides a secure foundation for how religion shaped American masculinity and how masculinity shaped American Judaism in the early twentieth century."</p> (Judith Gerson, author of By Thanksgiving We Were Americans: German Jewish Refugees and Holocaust Memory)<br><br><p>"There is so much literature&#x2015;and very good scholarship&#x2015;on Judaism and gender, but the majority of that literature reflects an interest in women.

Colorized in vivid, often exaggerated hues and printed on card stock embossed with a linen-like texture, linen postcards celebrated the American scene with views of majestic landscapes, modern cityscapes, roadside attractions, and other notable features. These colorful images portrayed the United States as shimmering with promise, quite unlike the black-and-white worlds of documentary photography or <i>Life</i> magazine. Linen postcards were enormously popular, with close to a billion printed and sold.</p><p><i>Postcard America</i> offers the first comprehensive study of these cards and their cultural significance. Drawing on the production files of Curt Teich &amp; Co. of Chicago, the originator of linen postcards, Jeffrey L. Meikle reveals how photographic views were transformed into colorized postcard images, often by means of manipulation&#x2014;adding and deleting details or collaging bits and pieces from several photos. He presents two extensive portfolios of postcards&#x2014;landscapes and cityscapes&#x2014;that comprise a representative iconography of linen postcard views. For each image, Meikle explains the postcard&#x2019;s subject, describes aspects of its production, and places it in social and cultural contexts. In the concluding chapter, he shifts from historical interpretation to a contemporary viewpoint, considering nostalgia as a motive for collectors and others who are fascinated today by these striking images.</p></p><p>Jeffrey L. Meikle teaches in the departments of American Studies and Art and Art History at the University of Texas at Austin, where he holds the Stiles Professorship in American Studies.

Meikle takes us on an incredible tour...[t]he book is breathtaking in its luxuriousness, a veritable treasure trove of American culture."

(<i>Journal of Cultural Geography</i> 2016-10-01)<br><br>"Postcard America is an exemplary work in the broad field of visual cultural studies and one that I recommend with great enthusiasm. Jeffrey Meikle&#x2019;s commentaries on these postcards are a tour de force, the work of a mature scholar with the necessary mastery of diverse disciplines&#x2014;technology, social history, business history, aesthetic history, and geography. Really extraordinary and fascinating to read."

Biosphere 2 began as an engineering marvel and an experiment in creating a self-sustaining, closed biological system that could support a team of humans for two years. In 1993, when the original Biosphere 2 experiment ended amid controversy, few could have predicted what the future would hold for the research facility. While briefly addressing the original experiment and its triumphs and shortcomings, Carson focuses on telling a compelling story of the scientific research being conducted at Biosphere 2 today and the importance of that work in understanding our biosphere: the planet Earth. This enlightening title adeptly connects Biosphere 2's past with its present and future. Stunning photographs, clear and colorful graphics, and illuminating insets enhance the appeal, and direct quotes from the Biosphere 2 scientists are liberally incorporated throughout. The processes, products, and purposes of the research are addressed, and information about the facility's past is provided in a series of "Flashback to the Biospherians" photographic sidebars.

Hudson, in full William Henry Hudson (born August 4, 1841, near Buenos Aires, Argentina&#x2014;died August 18, 1922, London, England), British author, naturalist, and ornithologist, best known for his exotic romances, especially Green Mansions. Hudson&#x2019;s parents were originally New Englanders who took up sheep farming in Argentina. He spent his childhood&#x2014;lovingly recalled in Far Away and Long Ago (1918)&#x2014;freely roaming the pampas, studying the plant and animal life, and observing both natural and human dramas on what was then a lawless frontier. After an illness at 15 permanently affected his health, he became introspective and studious; his reading of Charles Darwin&#x2019;s Origin of Species, which confirmed his own observations of nature, had a particularly strong impact. After his parents&#x2019; death, he led a wandering life. Little is known of this period or of his early years in England, where he settled in 1869 (and was naturalized in 1900). Poverty and ill-health may have occasioned his marriage in 1876 to a woman much older than himself. He and his wife lived precariously on the proceeds of two boardinghouses, until she inherited a house in the Bayswater section of London, where Hudson spent the rest of his life. His early books, romances with a South American setting, are weak in characterization but imbued with a brooding sense of nature&#x2019;s power. Although Hudson&#x2019;s reputation now rests chiefly on these novels, when published they attracted little attention. The first, The Purple Land that England Lost, 2 vol. (1885), was followed by several long short stories, collected in 1902 as El Omb�. His last romance, Green Mansions (1904), is the strange love story of Rima, a mysterious creature of the forest, half bird and half human. Rima, the best known of Hudson&#x2019;s characters, is the subject of the statue by Jacob Epstein in the bird sanctuary erected in Hudson&#x2019;s memory in Hyde Park, London, in 1925. The romances secured Hudson the friendship of many English men of letters, among them Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Edward Garnett, and George Gissing. His books on ornithological studies (Argentine Ornithology, 1888&#x2013;89; British Birds, 1895; etc.) brought recognition from the statesman Sir Edward Grey, who procured him a state pension in 1901. He finally achieved fame with his books on the English countryside&#x2014;Afoot in England (1909), A Shepherd&#x2019;s Life (1910), Dead Man&#x2019;s Plack (1920), A Traveller in Little Things (1921), and A Hind in Richmond Park (1922). By their detailed, imaginative descriptions, conveying the sensations of one who accepted nature in all its aspects, these works did much to foster the &#x201c;back-to-nature&#x201d; movement of the 1920s and 1930s but were subsequently little read.</p><p>William Henry Hudson (4 August 1841 &#x2013; 18 August 1922) was an author, naturalist, and ornithologist.</p><h2>Buffy Sainte-Marie: The Authorized Biography</h2><p><p><strong>"Buffy Sainte-Marie is an icon and inspiration.

How did the Universe become self-aware? In <i>The Runes of Evolution</i>, Simon Conway Morris revitalizes the study of evolution from the perspective of convergence, providing us with compelling new evidence to support the mounting scientific view that the history of life is far more predictable than once thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> A leading evolutionary biologist at the University of Cambridge, Conway Morris came into international prominence for his work on the Cambrian explosion (especially fossils of the Burgess Shale) and evolutionary convergence, which is the process whereby organisms not closely related (not monophyletic), independently evolve similar traits as a result of having to adapt to similar environments or ecological niches.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Runes of Evolution</i>, he illustrates how the ubiquity of convergence hints at an underlying framework whereby many outcomes, not least brains and intelligence, are virtually guaranteed on any Earth-like planet. Conway Morris also emphasizes how much of the complexity of advanced biological systems is inherent in microbial forms.<br> &nbsp;<br> By casting a wider net, <i>The Runes of Evolution</i> explores many neglected evolutionary questions. Some are remarkably general. Why, for example, are convergences such as parasitism, carnivory, and nitrogen fixation in plants concentrated in particular taxonomic hot spots? Why do certain groups have a particular propensity to evolve toward particular states?<br> &nbsp;<br> Some questions lead to unexpected evolutionary insights: If bees sleep (as they do), do they dream? Why is that insect copulating with an orchid? Why have sponges evolved a system of fiber optics? What do mantis shrimps and submarines have in common? If dinosaurs had not gone extinct what would have happened next? Will a saber-toothed cat ever re-evolve?<br> &nbsp;<br> Cona Morris observes: &#x201c;Even amongst the mammals, let alone the entire tree of life, humans represent one minute twig of a vast (and largely fossilized) arborescence. Every living species is a linear descendant of an immense string of now-vanished ancestors, but evolution itself is the very reverse of linear. Rather it is endlessly exploratory, probing the vast spaces of biological hyperspace. Indeed this book is a celebration of how our world is (and was) populated by a riot of forms, a coruscating tapestry of life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><i>The Runes of Evolution</i> is the most definitive synthesis of evolutionary convergence to be published to date.</p><p><b>Simon Conway Morris</b> is a leading evolutionary biologist and best known for his work on the Cambrian explosion (especially the Burgess Shale) and evolutionary convergence. He is also active in public outreach, especially in the area of science and religion where he also published extensively. A frequent guest on radio, and also with many television appearances, he has pioneered an extremely successful website on convergence (www.mapoflife.org) and is now constructing a new one addressing the wider issues of evolution. Based in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge, where he holds the chair in evolutionary palaeobiology, he is also a fellow of St. John&#x2019;s College. His work has taken him to many parts of the world, including China, Mongolia, and Greenland.<p>"The runes of evolution spell out a surprising message: Some evolutionary outcomes are virtually inevitable. Or, so goes the argument of Cambridge palaeontologist Simon Conway Morris, resting on two key premises:</p><ol><li>Evolution repeats itself in unexpected ways:&nbsp; Very different lineages evolve to have similar traits. Conway Morris calls this 'convergence.'</li><li>Precursors of complex traits, such as a nervous system, are found in much simpler organisms. Conway Morris calls this 'evolutionary inherency.' The premises are supported with a wealth of data&#x2014;thousands of references across the book&#x2019;s 27 chapters.</li></ol><p>The intriguing tale is told by way of a journey over many different areas in which we find convergence and inherency, with touches of humour along the way." &#x2014;Zachary&nbsp;Ardern, <i>BioLogos</i></p><br><br>&#x201c;Conway Morris&#x2019;s exploration of the phenomenon of convergence in biological evolution is rife with implications for Christian theology. It lends credence to a Christian view of God&#x2019;s providential action in history, and it supports an ecological view of the interdependence of all things in God&#x2019;s creation. It also fits with a scriptural account of a story-shaped&nbsp;world.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ian&nbsp;Curran, <i>Christian Century</i><br><br> "This is a very good book. The author&nbsp;is most effective when presenting his evidence as&nbsp;both glaringly obvious and unfairly maligned. Not&nbsp;everyone will like the volume&#x2019;s familiar tone, but&nbsp;the overall excellence of the writing is hard to deny.&nbsp;Many of the book&#x2019;s grandest ideas were already covered&nbsp;in his previous publications, but The Runes of&nbsp;Evolution is nevertheless Conway Morris&#x2019; most comprehensive&nbsp;statement on convergence to date, and&nbsp;is thus well worth reading." &#x2014;Abraham H. Gibson, <i>Quarterly Review of Biology (</i>September 2017)<br><br>This book was presumably written by Morris more for fellow natural scientists&nbsp;than for philosophers and theologians, but in each case so as to prove that his&nbsp;hypothesis of ongoing convergence in evolution is not a series of fortuitous coinci-dences but empirical evidence of established patterns or in-built mechanisms within&nbsp;the evolutionary process. Three hundred pages of text with double columns of print&nbsp;on each page and 150 pages of endnotes make that clear. Names of different species, genera, families, orders, classes, and so on turn up on virtually every page so&nbsp;that the nonprofessional reader ends up hunting for summary statements by Morris&nbsp;at the end of each major subdivision within the 26 chapters. Yet despite its obvious&nbsp;density and degree of detail for the ordinary reader, the implications of this book for&nbsp;philosophical/theological understanding of the God&#x2013;world relationship and for the&nbsp;classic distinction between the natural and the supernatural within creation are in&nbsp;my judgment very significant. &#x2014;Joseph A. Bracken, SJ, Xavier University, Cincinnati</p><h2>Sex and the Cthulhu Mythos</h2><p>H. P. Lovecraft was one of the most asexual beings in history-at least by his own admission. Whether we accept this view of his own sexual instincts or not, there is no denying that sexuality-normal and aberrant-underlies a number of significant tales in the Lovecraft oeuvre. The impregnation of a human woman by Yog-Sothoth in "The Dunwich Horror" and the mating of humans with strange creatures from the sea in "The Shadow over Innsmouth" are only two such examples.<br><br>In this pioneering study, Bobby Derie has presented an objective and scholarly analysis of the significant uses of love, gender, and sex in the work of H. P. Lovecraft and some of his leading disciples. Along the way, Derie treats such matters as Lovecraft's relations with his wife, portrayals of women in his work, and the question of homosexuality in his life and work. Many Lovecraft stories are subject to detailed examination for their sexual implications.<br><br>Derie then examines the work of such significant writers of the Lovecraft tradition as Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, Ramsey Campbell, W. H. Pugmire, and Caitl�n R. Kiernan, whose work features far more explicit sexuality than anything Lovecraft could have imagined. Derie goes on to study sexual themes in other venues, such as Lovecraftian occultism, Japanese manga and anime, and even Lovecraftian fan fiction.<br><br>The result is a comprehensive and incisive examination of a delicate subject-but one whose significance in Lovecraftian writing can hardly be denied.</p><p></p><h2>Another Jar of Tiny Stars: Poems by More NCTE Award-Winning Poets</h2><p>A Jar of Tiny Stars is one of the most popular poetry books from WordSong.

We must understand who and what its originators were, and gain some idea as to the forces which influenced and shaped their philosophy. Unfortunately, any deep down discussion of Communism and Marxism involves the Jewish question. We cannot honestly discuss the subject without revealing and commenting on the fact that the founders of Russian Communism were Jewish. Neither can we ignore the fact that all but a few of the top leadership of the American Communist party including the recently convicted spies are of the same race. These are facts of history over which we have no control. But we are faced with the very serious problem of how to reveal these facts without being labeled and treated as &#34;anti-Semites.&#34; The main reason why so little is known concerning the true nature of Communism stems from this problem. Historical writers have been understandably reluctant to hold forth on the subject for fear of marking themselves as &#34;race haters&#34; and &#34;bigots.&#34; For this reason, the entire subject has been placed beyond the pale of discussion. One simply does not use the word &#34;Jews&#34; and &#34;Communism&#34; together. The result is, of course, censorship. In this work we have decided to breach the wall of silence at whatever cost, and to treat the subject as fairly and as honestly as we know how. No attempt is made to single out individuals because they happened to be born to a certain race; neither have we exempted anyone from criticism for that reason. It was decided that since Communism and Judaism are so irretrievably bound one to the other, a history of the Jewish people would contribute substantially to an understanding of the present Communist menace.</p><p>Frank L. Britton was one of America's leading post-war anti-Communists, who produced two books on the history of Communism and Judaism: <i>Behind Communism<i> and <i>The Hoax of Soviet "Anti-Semitism": Jews, Zionism, Communism, Israel and the Soviet Union 1918-1991.</i></i></i></p><h2>Vamps and the City (Love at Stake, Book 2)</h2><p><p>Who says a vamp can't have it all? </p><p> Darcy Newhart thought it was a stroke of genius&#x2014;the first&#x2013;ever reality TV show where mortals vie with vampires for the title of The Sexiest Man on Earth.

Now she just has to make sure that a mortal doesn't win. If only she wasn't so distracted by a super&#x2013;sexy and <em>live</em> contestant named Austin... </p><p> But Darcy doesn't know the worst of it. Austin Erickson is actually a vampire slayer! And he's got his eye on the show's leggy blond director. Only problem is, he's never wanted any woman&#x2014;living or dead&#x2014;as badly. But if he wins her heart, will he lose his soul? And if it means an eternity of hot, passionate loving with Darcy, does that really matter anyway?</p></p><p><p>Kerrelyn Sparks is the bestselling author of the Love at Stake series, which has hit as high as number 5 on the <em>New York Times</em> list and 22 on the <em>USA Today</em> list. Kerrelyn is honored that her band of merry vampires and shifters is spreading love and laughter worldwide in fourteen different languages.</p>After spending the last four years living in a vampire harem, Darcy Newhart knew her television career was over. Even if the vampires, nice as they are, were willing to let her return to her former life, everyone thinks she is dead. So when the chance to work for DVN, the Digital Vampire Network, presents itself, Darcy seizes the opportunity. Inspired by the popularity of reality television, Darcy proposes the idea for a show called "The Sexiest Man on Earth," in which a vampire harem picks their new master. What the vampires at DVN don't know is that to give the show a twist, Darcy plans on including a few mortal men among the candidates. What Darcy doesn't know is that one of those mortals is Austin Erickson, a CIA agent whose mission is to kill vampires. Sparks skillfully infuses her writing with a deliciously sharp wit, and the second in her sexy contemporary vampire series is wickedly fun. <i>John Charles</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But what brought him unprecedented fame outside his own discipline is undoubtedly his theory of relativity, which revolutionized the old, established Newtonian picture of space, time, and gravitation."Professor Hanoch Gutfreund, from the Introduction This volume, an abridged version of our cloth, slipcased edition, presents one of the most influential scientific documents of the twentieth century: Albert Einstein's exposition of the theory of relativity. Each of the seventy-two handwritten pages are reproduced and are accompanied by an English translation of the original German text. A tribute to Einstein's genius, <i>Einstein's 1912 Manuscript on the Special Theory of Relativity</i> opens with a brief essay by Hanoch Gutfreund, a chronology of Einstein's life, a selection of quotes by Einstein, and, to introduce the manuscript, a detailed description of the manuscript, its contents, publication history, and provenance. The manuscript pages themselves then follow, reproduced in full color, with the English translation facing each page. Subtle variations in paper and ink are clearly visible in the excellent reproductions, indicating where and when Einstein drafted certain parts. Because the manuscript shows extensive reworking, it reveals Einstein's thought processes more than any other of his handwritten works.

These quilts, called ralli, are stunning in their designs, brilliant in their colors, and intriguing in their history. The designs, which include patchwork, appliqu*/e, and embroidered styles, are reminiscent of motifs found on painted pottery from the ancient civilizations of the area. Showcased here are more than 130 stunning ralli quilts, all shown in full color. They date primarily from the mid- to late twentieth century and feature a wondrous array of designs and patterns that have been passed from mother to daughter and woman to woman for hundreds of years. Quilt descriptions identify where each quilt was made, design or pattern characteristics, type of fabric, and dimensions. The carefully researched text provides intriguing information on quilt construction, colors, patterns, and regional variations. A valuable reference for textile historians, designers, and quilt lovers everywhere, this book is a tribute to the skill and creativity of the &#34;ralli region&#34; people who continue to make and use these beautiful textiles.</p><p>Patricia Ormsby Stoddard has been a textile enthusiast for many years.

One Child at a Time</h2><p><i>"In this world, you were loved."</i> <br> <br> The inspiring story of how one woman's message of hope and opportunity will change the lives of an entire generation. <br> <br> Three schools, two orphanages, a hospital, and an abandoned-infant home -- constructed in the poorest country in the western hemisphere -- were the result of one quick television commercial. The ad was for a charity, asking for donations to help impoverished children in a third world country. Though author Susie Scott Krabacher had a little money to give, what she wanted was to hold the hand of every child she saw and tell them that they were not forgotten and that they too were important. When Susie called the charity, it wanted only monetary donations -- and every other overseas nonprofit she contacted couldn't or wouldn't take on an inexperienced volunteer. So Susie set out to change the children's lives on her own. <br> <br> In this heartbreaking and inspiring memoir, Susie Scott Krabacher tells how the pain in her past caused her to doubt if God really loved and protected her. From her abusive childhood to her experiences as a Playboy centerfold during the 1980s, Susie details with frank honesty how she lost her faith along the way and how her experiences helping children in Haiti, an impoverished nation only five hundred miles from Florida, brought God back into her life. <br> <br> In a country where 10 percent of all children die before the age of four, Susie mounted a brave effort to provide not just charity but opportunity. By treating the children she helps as individuals, Susie gives them the tools to save their own country. Although some of the children she's tirelessly worked to rescue do not survive, Susie will never again lose her faith.</p><p>Susie Scott Krabacher began traveling to Haiti during the mid-1990s and contributed her own money for schools, hospitals, and humanitarian aid in that country. For her efforts, Susie has been made an honorary Haitian citizen. She also received the Humanitarian Rose Award, presented by the People�s Princess Foundation, Inc., which was established by Maureen Rorech Dunkel to further Princess Diana�s commitment to the needy. Susie lives with her husband in Aspen, Colorado.<p> Chapter 1 </p><p> Coffin Notes </p><p> IN THE WINTER OF 1995, I toured the pediatric and maternity wards of the government hospital in Port-au-Prince for the first time. Nearing the hospital, I could see dozens of women in the entryway, some clearly in advanced stages of pregnancy, others already holding tiny babies or toddlers against their breasts. A few were lying on straw mats or leaning against the concrete building, sweltering in the tropical heat. It seemed that each woman I passed either mumbled incoherently or wept, hands pressed to her face, her tears running between crooked callused knuckles. I had brought a few Haitian <i>gourdes</i> and American dollars to purchase water and medicine for the patients. I didn't yet know what else I could do. </p><p> An elderly gentleman dozed in the entryway with a shotgun balanced on his thighs. I gently tapped on the metal door frame beside him, and he started from his nap. Grasping his shotgun with one hand and the waistband of his britches with the other, he fumbled to keep his pants from falling down over his protruding hip bones. </p><p> "State your beezness," he said irritably, his English thickly accented with Creole.* </p><blockquote> *Haiti has two official languages -- French and Creole (sometimes spelled Krey�l). The majority of Haitians (about 90 percent) speak only Creole, a hybrid of French that includes some Spanish, African, and Taino dialects. English and Spanish are also spoken on a limited basis, particularly in the business community. </blockquote> <p> "She eez missionary." My companion, Viximar, a Haitian national, family man, and trusted friend, answered for me, although I disliked that description of myself and considered it inaccurate. I had come to Haiti without a Christian agenda or connection to an organization, only the desire to make good on a promise I made to God when I was little. </p><p> The elderly security guard waved us through. Once inside, I thumped Viximar on the arm. </p><p> "Don't lie!" I said. </p><p> He grinned. The word <i>missionary</i> always seemed to facilitate entry when needed. </p><p> If nothing else, I had come to Haiti hoping to leave my demons behind me, but soon after I arrived I realized that I had, in fact, fled to their native land. I had first come to this small country -- a mere five hundred miles south of Florida -- more than a year earlier, and in the twelve months that followed, I had witnessed more pain, suffering, and death than I could have possibly previously imagined. Though I had no earlier training or experience as a relief worker -- my last job was owner of an antique shop in Aspen, Colorado -- I somehow was able to start a small school and feeding program in Cit� Soleil, a ravished district in the Haitian capital, arguably the worst slum in the Western Hemisphere. Viximar lived there with his family and was guardian of my school. </p><p> The hospital I was visiting with Viximar was the government hospital, and while it's not the only one in Haiti, it is the cheapest, and meant for the poorest of the poor. When Viximar and I went inside we found three large wards, each measuring around twenty by twenty feet. About a hundred children and infants lay in the three rooms. Most of them were covered with flies and ants, and though they must have ranged in age from a few months to several years, it was difficult to tell, given the distortions of illness and malnutrition. Some of the children appeared to be there alone; others had an adult holding vigil nearby; many of them were crying. But the ones who immediately caught and held my attention were the children who simply stared. They seemed oblivious to the swarms of flies and ants feasting on their excrement. They were alone with no adult to watch over them, their tiny faces sculpted only by bones, hunger, and fear. </p><p> Words penned by Elie Wiesel, Nobel Prize-winning journalist and Nazi-concentration-camp survivor, have haunted me since I first read them. Wiesel spoke of an old man who could no longer fight and would soon be a victim of the "selection." In the concentration camps during the Holocaust it was a frequently used term for those weakened and no longer able to perform labor. They were <i>selected</i> for extermination. It was only now, as I looked into the eyes of these children, that the meaning truly penetrated my soul: "Suddenly his eyes would become blank, nothing but two open wounds, two pits of horror." </p><p> These children in the Haitian hospital had also been selected. For them it would only be a matter of time. </p><p> As I stood in the pediatric ward of the government hospital, I wanted to cry. <i>No</i>, I wanted to scream. But during the past year that I had worked in Haiti I had learned to do the opposite of what I would normally do back home in Aspen. So I stood there and thought through the situation: If I had been one of these children or mothers lying here, wondering if I was going to die, and I had seen a white woman, maybe for the first time, I would have been terrified. And if any woman would have looked at me and started crying, let alone screaming, I would have thought something horrible was happening to me. </p><p> So there was my answer. I wouldn't cry. I wouldn't turn away. I would do the opposite. Or something close to it, anyway: I would sing. And so I began to hum very lightly and smile at each person I passed, reaching out to touch tiny hands and feet. </p><p> I was afraid I would hurt the patients as I touched them; they had so many sores and bandages. I had never witnessed such agony. I wondered how many foreigners heard about this place and came, saw, cried, and left, never to forget it, yet leaving everything just as it was, as if they were never here at all. For several hours I walked through the maze of iron cribs and stained cots, in and out of the rooms, observing every kind of deformity, handicap, and disease that could be imagined. </p><p> I had spent the twenty years before I came to Haiti focused inward, on myself. My ambition had been to transform myself into someone who would be loved. Not satisfied with my natural state, I spent days at the hair salon and gym, manicuring, pedicuring, soaking, dyeing, running, tanning, waxing, and dieting. I read dozens of self-help books: <i>Dianetics</i>. <i>Psycho-Cybernetics</i>. <i>The Road Less Traveled</i>. <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>. <i>Transcendental Meditation</i>. <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i>. <i>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</i>. From the moment I left my parents' home, at age fifteen, my sole purpose in life had been "self" improvement. I walked out the door with no money and only a tenth-grade education. But I knew a few things. I knew that the only way I would ever make it through my remaining seventy years -- what I figured I had left -- would be on my own. Not that I hadn't heard of God; I knew all about God. First, that He was slow. And second, that He seemed to have a mean streak, at least when it came to me. </p><p> Over the years, as part of my "self improvement," I had carefully buried my childhood memories, putting them safely in the ground, one by one, where I could keep track of them and keep them from contaminating my improved self. In the hospital in Haiti, as I walked on through each of the rooms, still singing quietly, I knew that for these children, growing up in this lonely place would result in the same sort of personal graveyard. If they ever got to grow up. </p><p> For years, I had scarcely touched a Bible, although I had gone to church every Sunday during my childhood in Alabama. I had spent most of each sermon watching the clock and hoping the preacher really meant it when he said "...and in conclusion..." for the seventh or eighth time. But the thousands of hours spent in a church pew had burned a complete set of hymns and Bible verses into my brain. Sometimes, when in trouble or depressed, I would hear the Psalms or other verses -- not as if they came from memory, but from an invisible presence between my shoulders. That presence returned to me while I was in the hospital ward, and I began to put words to my humming, quietly singing the comforting parts of hymns I remembered: "Oh Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder / consider all the works Thy hands have made..." </p><p> Through the rooms I sang, I hummed, I smiled, and I touched. So many sick people. So much despair. </p><p> INSIDE A RUSTED CRIB lay a bundle of rags with a skeletal face nestled inside. A woman, the mother, I assumed, leaned over the rail. She wept, seemingly inconsolable, and clutched a small square piece of paper. I avoided going near her when I first walked by because I didn't want to disturb her privacy and obvious grief. I later learned to recognize that reaction as a peculiarly American one. </p><p> With my tour nearly over, I was ready to leave the bundle of diapers we had brought for whoever needed them and go back to the hotel. I was finished with watching people suffer. But something inside me made me turn and walk back to the woman by the rusted crib. For a minute or so, I simply stood near her. I watched her as, through her tears, she followed the tiny spiral of her baby's rib cage, heaving up and down. The baby stared at the mother, sluggish but awake. As with so many of the other babies, ants scuttled around and within her badly dirtied diaper. </p><p> Gently, I laid my hand on the woman's shoulder. She lifted her head for a second and then collapsed under my touch. Viximar, who was at my side, rushed to catch her before she hit the floor. She was frail and gaunt, not more than eighty pounds. I asked Viximar to take some of my gourdes, buy water from one of the vendors on the street, and quickly get her something to eat, if he could find it. He helped me settle the woman near a wall beside the crib. </p><p> "Ti-Judith," the woman whispered, gazing weakly up to where her tiny daughter lay. That was the child's name: Ti-Judith. </p><p> I removed my fanny pack from around my waist and placed it under the mother's head so that her cheek did not rest on the filthy concrete floor. I returned to the baby, Ti-Judith, and peeled away the diaper that stuck between her teeny legs. It w...</p></p><h2>Log Cabin Restructured: 23 Log Cabin Quilt Projects Made with Triangles, Diamonds, Hexagons and Curves</h2><p><b>Be inspired by the versatility of the log cabin design!</b><br><br> In addition to learning the basics of constructing a traditional log cabin block, with <i>Log Cabin Restructured</i>, you'll see innovative ways that this beloved motif can be used, such as diamonds, triangles, hexagons, and curves.<br><br> Based on one of the most popular quilting motifs in history, Shizuko Kuroha provides more than twenty distinctly different projects constructed from log cabin block variations, including pin cushions, potholders, pouches, pillows, wall hangings, and full-sized quilts.</p><p>Shizuko Kuroha is a celebrated quilter in Japan.

He is the author of 20 previous books including the bestselling novel <i>Snow in August</i> and the bestselling memoir <i>A Drinking Life.</i> He lives in New York City.Hamill (North River) forays into Dominic Dunne society crime territory before veering uncomfortably into a far-fetched terrorist plot. Just as the last ever edition of the New York World is getting put to bed, veteran editor Sam Briscoe stops the presses for a sensational murder: socialite Cynthia Harding and her personal secretary are found stabbed to death in Harding's Manhattan town house. The story unfolds in time-stamped, you-are-there bursts that follow a large cast, including several journalists; Cynthia's adopted daughter; a disgraced Madoff-like financier; a media blogger; the murdered secretary's husband, a police officer assigned to a counterterrorism task force, as well as their son, a convert to radical Islam; and best of all by the weary and worldly Briscoe himself. Hamill is at his best in the Briscoe portions, rich in print anecdotes and mournful for a passing age, but as both the initial murders and the closing of the paper play into a larger plot and the young extremist becomes the driving force of the novel, the quality slides precipitously, and, as if sensing defeat, the book is brought to a too abrupt conclusion with most of the principals gathered for a group of scenes that strain credulity. Hamill nails the dying newsroom, but gets lost on the terrorism beat. (May) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

He discloses its relation to Hazlitt&#39;s idea of &#34;gusto&#34; and to Shakespearean notions of impersonality and intensity while also demonstrating how negative capability presages Bergson&#39;s conceptual interpretation of intellect and intuition. Bate reveals how the key elements of Keats&#39;s poetic concept are disinterestedness, sympathy, impersonality, and dramatic poetry, defining negative capability as &#34;the ability to negate or lose one&#39;s identity in something larger than oneself - a sympathetic openness to the concrete reality without, an imaginative identification, a relishing and understanding of it.&#34; With &#39;negative capability,&#39; Keats railed against the rampant egotism of his epoch and challenged the certainty of its claims to knowledge. While embracing reality, Keats urged the necessity of abiding in uncertainties, mysteries, and doubts. This new edition brings back into print Bate&#39;s indispensable work and features an introduction by the distinguished Italian poet, playwright, and literary critic Maura Del Serra. With its republication, Eliot&#39;s proclamation on Keats is given new force: that &#34;there is hardly one statement of Keats about poetry which ... will not be found to be true...&#34;</p><p>Walter Jackson Bate was Abbott Lawrence Lowell Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University.

Concerned with the problem of ethical responsibility in a world with no unified system of values, he turned to literature as the appropriate form for considering those human problems not subject to rational treatment.<p>Late in life, Broch began questioning his artistic pursuits and turned from literature to devote himself to political theory. While he is well known and highly regarded throughout the world as a novelist, he was equally accomplished as an essayist. These six essays give us a fascinating glimpse into the mind of one of the twentieth century's most original thinkers.</p></p><p>Hermann Broch (1886-1951) was born in Vienna. He studied philosophy and mathematics, was active in labor relations, and wrote sociological and literary essays. At the time of his death he was researching mass psychology at Yale University.Though best known to American scholars as an unsung master novelist (The Death of Virgil; The Sleepwalkers), Austrian-born Broch (1886-1951) also penned challenging, provocative essays. The six collected here, among the few to have been translated into English, represent the dominant themes in Broch's writings. For most of his life, the author concerned himself with the role of art in an era he felt was undergoing a "dissolution of values." Indeed, all but one of these essays are based on Broch's belief that Western culture had lost its unifying value-set, and was thus floundering, ethically and esthetically, as it waited for the emergence of another prevalent set of values. Not surprisingly, he champions art that represents universal human experience; he repeatedly cites James Joyce's Ulysses as being uniquely of its time, even as it revived the principles of Homeric myth. In "Evil in the Value-System of Art," Broch argues that kitsch, because it is imitative rather than original and seeks beauty rather than truth, is "the evil in art." Broch's ideas and ideals are nothing if not rarified, but the rigor of his thought and the strength of his belief in art's ability-duty, even-to restore a culture's universal mythic knowledge is striking. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The New York Times Large-Print Brainbuilder Crosswords: 120 Large-Print Easy to Hard Puzzles from the Pages of The New York Times</h2><p><p>Large-print type may make these puzzles from the pages of<i> The New York Times</i> easy on the eyes, but they will still challenge the brain.</p><p>This brand new Large-Print Omnibus features:<br>*120 easy-to-read crossword puzzles<br>*All levels of difficulty<br>*Edited by crossword maven, Will Shortz!</p></p><p>WILL SHORTZ has edited <i>The New York Times</i> crossword puzzles since 1993.

And like the first volume, this new collection is marked by subtle charm, existential wit, a playful sensibility, and a probing mind. Dive in for more Henrietta and her cat, Fellini; more Mandlebaum, the teddy bear; more sensitive robot, and much else besides!</p><p><b>Liniers</b> (Ricardo Siri) is an acclaimed and well-beloved Argentine cartoonist, whose wildly popular daily strip <i>Macanudo</i> ( cool&#x201d;) has been published in the Argentine newspaper <i>La Naci�n</i> for the past ten years. This strip has won him fans throughout the world and comparisons to the cartoonist heavyweights Charles Schultz and Bill Watterson. Liniers also travels around the world with musician Kevin Johansen, painting on big canvases on stage while Johansen makes music. Sometimes, they switch places. Liniers has over 3,600 published comic strips and has published over twenty-five books in Spanish, and more than ten books in nine countries from Brazil to the Czech Republic. His first book to be published in English, <i>The Big Wet Balloon</i>, has been both a critical and popular success and was selected as a best book of 2013 by <i>Parents Magazine</i>. And the fourth volume of his <i>Macanudo</i> to appear in French was recently selected for the 2014 Angoul�me Festival. Together with his wife Angie, Liniers also founded the comics publisher La Editorial Com�n. Liniers lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with his wife and three daughters Matilda, Clementina, and Emma. No penguins though. . . yet.</p><br></p><p>Liniers: Liniers was born in Buenos Aires in 1973. He has created many illustrations &amp; comics for the press, collections and anthologies. His series <i>Macanudo</i> is published daily in Argentina's largest newspaper, <i>La Nacion</i>.<br><br>Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Sweet and surreal, the latest entry of comic vignettes selected from the Argentinian newspaper La Naci�n explores existentialism and the human experience with trademark humor. In crayon, ink, and watercolor, Liniers brings characters such as Henrietta and her cat Mandelbaum, the Bovine Movie Critic, Z-25 the Sensitive Robot, and penguins into more philosophical debates and playful scenarios. The illustrations are colorful, clever, and executed with a keen sense of graphic efficiency. Parallels can be drawn between Macanudo and Calvin and Hobbes; the child-view of the world is refreshing, deep, and playful. Not all young readers will understand the jokes about the 90s, structure versus function, or Socrates, but they will be attracted to each page, which contains six brightly drawn comics without linear or connected narratives. Liniers is also a master of meta-jokes: characters talk about being drawn and the panels are often cinematic. This collection stands alone, so there's no need to read the previous volume. Like most graphic novels, this work will be enjoyable for reluctant readers and those who prefer narratives that are complemented by beautiful illustrations. This is one of those special books that won't bump circulation but may change a young person's life, as they inspire philosophical thought and urge readers to play and explore the world with open eyes while giggling at the gnomes in hats.&#x2014;Lisa Nowlain, Darien Library, CT</p><h2>Future Histories: What Ada Lovelace, Tom Paine, and the Paris Commune Can Teach Us About Digital Technology</h2><p><b>A highly engaging tour through progressive history in the service of emancipating our digital tomorrow.</b><br><br>When we talk about technology we always talk about tomorrow and the future -- which makes it hard to figure out how to even get there. In <i>Future Histories</i>, public interest lawyer and digital specialist Lizzie O'Shea argues that we need to stop looking forward and start looking backwards. Weaving together histories of computing and progressive social movements with modern theories of the mind, society, and self, O'Shea constructs a "usable past" that can help us determine our digital future.<br><br>What, she asks, can the Paris Commune tell us about earlier experiments in sharing resources--like the Internet--in common? How can Frantz Fanon's theories of anti colonial self-determination help us build digital world in which everyone can participate equally? Can debates over equal digital access be helped by American revolutionary Tom Paine's theories of democratic, economic redistribution? What can indigenous land struggles teach us about stewarding our digital climate? And, how is Elon Musk not a future visionary but a steampunk throwback to Victorian-era technological utopians?<br><br>In engaging, sparkling prose, O'Shea shows us how very human our understanding of technology is, and how when we draw on the resources of the past, we can see the potential for struggle, for liberation, for art and poetry in our technological present. <i>Future Histories</i> is for all of us--makers, coders, hacktivists, Facebook-users, self-styled Luddites--who find ourselves in a brave new world.</p><p><b>Lizzie O'Shea</b> is a lawyer, writer, and broadcaster. An experienced lawyer in Australia and internationally, specializing in human rights and Aboriginal rights in Australia, she has represented refugees, activists, and people targeted by national security legislation.

Almost everyone has been exposed to some aspects of World War I and II Germany and probably to a lesser extent, South America. However, only a few have delved deeply into the history of southern South America. Readers having an interest in and/or working knowledge of this area of world history from current sources will be amazed how this book puts incidents in perspective and makes the gaps in this history suddenly apparent. For example, the presence of German nationals and representatives of the German government in South America has always been more or less obvious to the public. The extent of this presence in terms of land ownership, businesses and manufacturing enterprises and the influence on countries such as Argentina as illustrated in this book will amaze even the knowledgeable reader.</p><p></p><h2>Armies of Celtic Europe 700 BC to AD 106: History, Organization and Equipment (Armies of the Past)</h2><p>Although comprised of many distinct tribes and groupings, the Celts shared a distinctive culture that dominated much of Europe for centuries. They enjoyed a formidable reputation as fierce and brave warriors, skilled horsemen and fine metalworkers. In 390 BC an alliance of Celtic tribes defeated a Roman army at the River Allia and went on to sack Rome and thenceforth the Romans lived under their threat. In the early third century BC a Celtic army swept into Macedonia and Greece, won a major victory at Thermopylai and ransacked the sacred sanctuary at Delphi. Such was their warlike prowess that, when not fighting their own wars, they were sought after as mercenaries by many armies, serving as far afield as southern Egypt. When the Romans invaded Gaul (France and Belgium) and the British Isles, Celtic armies resisted them fiercely.Gabriele Esposito studies this fascinating warrior culture, their armies, strategy, tactics and equipment (they invented the horned saddle and chainmail, and British armies were the last in Europe to use chariots on the battlefield). Dozens of color photographs of reenactors help bring these magnificent warriors back to life.</p><p>Gabriele Esposito is an Italian researcher and a long-time student of military history, whose interests and expertise range widely over various periods. He is the author of numerous books on armies and uniforms and is a regular contributor to many specialized magazines in Italy, France, Netherlands and UK.

What Megumi doesn't know (until that very moment anyway) is that his family is cursed to follow the orders of the Kogami family.</p><p>Matsuri Hino burst onto the manga scene with her title Kono Yume ga Sametara (When This Dream Is Over), which was published in LaLa DX magazine. Hino was a manga artist a mere nine months after she decided to become one. With the success of her popular series Toraware no Minoue (Captive Hearts), and MeruPuri, Hino has established herself as a major player in the world of shojo manga. Vampire Knight is currently serialized in LaLa and Shojo Beat magazines.Matsuri Hino, already well-known in America for her gothic romance manga Vampire Knight, tells a different sort of love story in Captive Hearts. Long ago, 20-year-old Megumi Kuroishi&#x2019;s ancestor stole a sacred scroll from the Kogami family, and the Kuroishi family has been cursed ever since to work as servants to the Kogamis. Now, in modern times, Megumi falls in love with the latest Kogami, Suzuka, and will do anything, absolutely anything, to serve her. His slavish devotion makes one wonder if it is the curse or his real feelings. This amusing setup is obviously directed at&nbsp;a female readership who would love to have a boy so devoted to them. And while&nbsp;the&nbsp;premise strives to be silly and out of this world, Captive Hearts does have its share of&nbsp;serious moments, especially toward the end of the volume, as Suzuka recalls being kidnapped as a young girl.

Recent DNA research confirms what anthropologists have been saying for nearly as many years, that Native Americans are originally from Siberia and Polynesians from Southeast Asia. In the current volume, molecular biologist Simon Southerton explains the theology and the science and how the former is being reshaped by the latter.<p>In the Book of Mormon, the Jewish prophet Lehi says the following after arriving by boat in America in 600 BCE:</p><p>Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves (2 Ne. 1:9).</p></p><p>&nbsp;Simon G. Southerton is Principal Research Scientist in the Applied Biotechnology and Genomics area of the Commonwealth Scientific laboratories (CSIRO) in Canberra, Australia. His Ph.D. is from the University of Sydney. He has published in&nbsp;New Phytologist, Plant Journal, Plant Molecular Biology,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Plant Physiology.&nbsp;He served an LDS mission to Melbourne in the 1980s.From the time of its publication in 1830, both the Book of Mormon and its translator, Joseph Smith Jr., have been the focus of admiration as well as criticism. The book's account of pre-Christian journeys from the Middle East to the Americas and subsequent identification of North American indigenous populations with Israelite tribes was not uncommon among Smith's contemporaries. Southerton, an Australian molecular scientist, explores these claims from a scientific standpoint and concludes that there is no evidence of Israelite descent among American Indians, Polynesians or others identified as ancestors of Book of Mormon peoples. Discussions about genetics and heredity can be a bit impenetrable to the nonscientist, but these constitute only part of the book. The author, raised Mormon but no longer a believer, uses the DNA issue to launch an attack on both bad science and what he perceives as widespread racism in the LDS Church. He blames the Book of Mormon for what he calls the church's "insidious view of a superior white race." Southerton proffers a book that is part scientific exploration and part anti-Mormon polemic, so it's likely to be closely studied by the Mormon apologetic community. Readers will decide for themselves how credible his arguments are. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

GABRIEL and PAUL L. SAVAGE<br><i>Crisis in Command: Mismanagement in the Army</i><br> Standard year 1978</p><p>PLANET ALGERON</p><p>Forward Operating Base Vickers sat atop a low mesa located just south of a mountain range called the Towers of Algeron. The FOB was named after a civilian who, according to official dispatches, &#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Volunteered to fight&#x2014;and gave her life to protect our legionnaires.&#x201d;</p><p>The truth was quite different. Carly Vickers had been working for the Bureau of Missing Persons, which, in spite of the innocent-sounding name, had been created to find and eliminate anyone who might oppose Empress Ophelia. People like Andromeda McKee. The bitch.</p><p>Now, as McKee stood on the top deck of the newly reconstructed observation tower and looked out over a snow-dusted plain, her mind was filled with images of the final attack. Thousands upon thousands of Naa warriors had surrounded the mesa, all determined to kill every Human they could lay their hands on. McKee could &#x201c;see&#x201d; them coming, and when she closed her eyes, they were still there. &#x201c;The CO is looking for you, Lieutenant.&#x201d; McKee opened her eyes. &#x201c;Lieutenant.&#x201d; It sounded strange. But there it was. The Legion had been a place to hide from Ophelia&#x2019;s synths at first. But now it was something more. The fact that she could become a soldier, and a good one, had been a revelation. Recruit, private, corporal, sergeant, and now lieutenant. She&#x2019;d come a long way.</p><p>Most of her superiors thought she deserved the most recent promotion. McKee knew better. She&#x2019;d been lucky, that&#x2019;s all. Lucky enough to survive as others fell. She turned. Corporal Smith had dark skin, intelligent eyes, and an engaging grin. &#x201c;I could tell the old man that you went AWOL.&#x201d;</p><p>McKee smiled. &#x201c;Thanks, Smith. Unfortunately there&#x2019;s no place to go. Keep your eyes peeled. I saw a glint of light just to the right of Finger Rock. A scout probably. Shoot the bastard if he gets too close.&#x201d;</p><p>The tower had four&nbsp;.50 cal sniper&#x2019;s rifles dedicated to that very purpose. Smith nodded. &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>McKee walked over to the stairs and began to make her way down to the ground. Her right calf was still sore where a bullet fired from Vickers&#x2019;s rifle had passed through it. She was lucky though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The bone was untouched, and she was alive.</p><p>FOB Vickers had undergone an amazing transformation during the last couple of months. Minefields ringed the bottom of the mesa now. Twenty-three autocannons were dug in on top&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the gaps between them were protected by heavy machine guns and mortars.</p><p>Two companies of legionnaires had been assigned to the mesa, including two platoons of cavalry, one of which belonged to her. McKee returned two salutes as she followed the path that led down into an underground bunker. It was a good deal larger than it had originally been, and that was a good thing.</p><p>A sentry snapped to attention as she entered. The ceiling was intentionally high so that Trooper Is could enter, and like the walls, it was made of duracrete slabs hooked together with rails and pins. The floor was covered with pea gravel. McKee&#x2019;s boots made crunching sounds as she approached the front desk. It was a sheet of plywood laid across two upended mortar boxes. A sergeant named Nichols sat behind it. She had a mop of curly red hair and a spray of freckles across her nose. &#x201c;Hey, Lieutenant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The major is looking for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I heard. Is he available?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. But watch out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He&#x2019;s pissed about something.&#x201d;</p><p>McKee nodded. &#x201c;Thanks for the heads-up.&#x201d;</p><p>As she made her way past the com section, logistics, and Intel, McKee caught glimpses of the video being provided by half a dozen surveillance drones. The ops center and the CO&#x2019;s &#x201c;office&#x201d; came next. If a desk surrounded by makeshift partitions could be dignified as such. McKee paused to knock. &#x201c;Lieutenant McKee reporting as&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cut the crap and come on in,&#x201d; Major Gordon said from the other side of the thin wall.</p><p>As McKee entered, she saw that Gordon was stripped to the waist and standing in front of a small wall-mounted mirror. There was white shaving gel on his face, and he was working with a straight razor. &#x201c;Take a load off McKee&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We&#x2019;re about to have company&#x2014;so it&#x2019;s time to make myself presentable.&#x201d;</p><p>Gordon was small but muscular, like the bantam-weight boxer he&#x2019;d once been. His black hair was combed straight back, and for some reason, he had chosen to grow a pencil-thin mustache. McKee sat on an empty cable spool and watched him work. &#x201c;Company, sir? What kind of company?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The <i>worst</i> kind,&#x201d; Gordon replied gloomily. &#x201c;A REMF (rear echelon mother fucker), a civilian, and a combot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A combot. Meaning an android equipped to make vids.&#x201d;</p><p>McKee felt a rising sense of apprehension. During a recent visit to Earth, she&#x2019;d been forced to make numerous public appearances, all calculated to benefit the person she hated most&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Empress Ophelia. No one had recognized her as Lady Catherine Carletto because of the scar that ran from just above her right eye down onto her left cheek. But that didn&#x2019;t mean she was safe. There was no such thing. She cleared her throat. &#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s up? A training vid?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hell no,&#x201d; Gordon replied, as he wiped the remaining gel off his face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be a McKee vid. Yeah, yeah, I know. You don&#x2019;t want to do it. Well, let me tell you something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There aren&#x2019;t many people of any rank who have the right to wear the Imperial Order of Merit. And now, having added a Star Cluster to that, you&#x2019;re a big deal on Earth. So the government sent a combot to make a documentary about you. And yes, you have to put up with it. The brass sees you as their number one recruiter.&#x201d;</p><p>McKee was about to object when Nichols stepped into the room. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re here, sir. On pad two.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be right there,&#x201d; Gordon said as he buttoned his shirt. Then he turned to McKee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I really am. But there&#x2019;s nothing you can do. Just grit your teeth, let the combot do its thing, and the whole thing will be over before you know it. Come on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We wouldn&#x2019;t want to keep our visitors waiting, now would we?&#x201d;</p><p>Apprehension had morphed to fear by that time. And what felt like a rock occupied the pit of McKee&#x2019;s stomach as she followed Gordon up the back ramp and onto the surface. Clusters of floodlights came on as another two-hour-and-forty-two-minute day came to an abrupt end. That was the result of a rotation so fast that it created a bulge at the planet&#x2019;s equator. In fact, some of the higher peaks soared eighty thousand feet up into the sky and dwarfed both Everest on Earth and Olympic Mons on Mars.</p><p>A fly-form was sitting on the pad, and like all such aircraft, it was piloted by a cyborg rather than a bio bod. Just one of the many things that made the Legion different from the rest of the armed services. Some of the Legion&#x2019;s borgs were criminals who, having been executed for capital crimes, had chosen life in a brain box over the big nothing. Others were legionnaires who had been wounded so badly that they were left with no choice but to pilot a fly-form, quad, or T-1.</p><p>Three figures appeared at the top of the ramp as it was lowered to the ground. The first person to make his way down was a portly colonel dressed in starched camos and wearing a sidearm with ivory grips. Rather than the rough-outs real soldiers wore in the field, he sported mirror-bright barracks boots. A REMF for sure. Gordon and McKee saluted the officer as he arrived on the ground. The response was so crisp, McKee suspected that the gesture had been perfected in front of a mirror. &#x201c;As you were,&#x201d; the colonel said. &#x201c;My name is Cavenaugh.&#x201d;</p><p>Before Gordon could speak, Cavenaugh turned to introduce his companion. The civilian had shoulder-length black hair, big brown eyes, and olive-colored skin. She was dressed in khakis and desert boots. McKee figured she might weigh a hundred pounds soaking wet. &#x201c;This is Bindali Jivani,&#x201d; Cavenaugh said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a civilian contractor&#x2014;and we&#x2019;ll discuss her role shortly.&#x201d;</p><p>That was Gordon&#x2019;s opportunity to step forward and introduce McKee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard about you,&#x201d; Cavenaugh said. &#x201c;Order of Merit and all that. Well done.&#x201d;</p><p>The civilian offered her hand, and McKee shook it. &#x201c;My friends call me Bindy,&#x201d; Jivani said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you.&#x201d;</p><p>Jivani was so open, it was impossible not to like her. McKee smiled. &#x201c;Likewise, ma&#x2019;am. Welcome to Forward Operating Base Vickers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And this is Andy,&#x201d; Cavenaugh said, as the combot arrived. Like most machines that were designed to interact with Humans, Andy was an android. Meaning a robot made to look like a Human being. In this case a thirtysomething male with light brown hair, beige skin, and a perpetual smile. It didn&#x2019;t <i>need</i> clothes but wore some anyway. They were made of leatherlike tufskin and were too fashionable for Algeron. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to meet you,&#x201d; Andy said brightly. &#x201c;Please stand closer together. I need a three shot.&#x201d;</p><p>That was when McKee realized that one if not both of Andy&#x2019;s &#x201c;eyes&#x201d; were cameras. She had no choice but to comply and wondered how long Andy would hang around. A couple of days? A week? Hopefully no more than that.</p><p>Gordon led the way back to the bunker, with Cavenaugh at his side. That left McKee to walk with Jivani. Andy followed along behind. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very beautiful, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; the civilian said, as she looked out over the desertlike wasteland. And it <i>was</i> beautiful. Or had been. Back before McKee had seen thousands of people die on it.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; McKee answered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how the whole planet is. Or the parts I&#x2019;ve seen anyway. Beautiful but dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>Jivani nodded and said something in a language that McKee knew to be Naa. A Human who spoke Naa! That was rare indeed. Most people relied on computerized translators. &#x201c;The words you spoke&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What did they mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an old folk saying. &#x2018;The blade that gleams can also cut deep.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you live here?&#x201d;</p><p>Jivani smiled and shook her head. &#x201c;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I arrived last week.&#x201d;</p><p>McKee wanted to ask more questions, but they were belowground by then. Gordon apologized for the lack of a meeting room as they entered his office. Cavenaugh sat in Gordon&#x2019;s chair. That left the rest of them to perch on cable spools. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get to it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;d like to stay and get a feel for the area&#x2014;but I promised General Vale that I would join her for dinner at 1800 hours. Annoying, but that&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;</p><p>McKee got the feeling that Cavenaugh was anything but annoyed by the obligation and looking forward to dinner. <i>Any</i> dinner. But especially one that might help to advance his career.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, of course,&#x201d; Gordon responded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my understanding that Andy is supposed to make a vid about Lieutenant McKee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one aspect of the situation,&#x201d; Cavenaugh agreed judiciously. &#x201c;But not the most important part of what we need to accomplish. I have a mission for Lieutenant McKee. A tricky mission, which, if successful, will help us to fully secure the planet. I trust both of you know who Chief of Chiefs Truthsayer is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; McKee answered. Momentarily forgetting to say, &#x201c;sir.&#x201d; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the one who sent warriors north to fight Chief Lifetaker&#x2019;s alliance. They also attacked the village of Doothdown and the legionnaires stationed on this mesa.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct,&#x201d; Cavenaugh agreed. &#x201c;And you beat him fair and square.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir. I wasn&#x2019;t in command.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, but according to official records, the strategy employed to beat him was <i>yours</i>. So you beat him fair and square. And that, according to Ms. Jivani here, means that you are qualified to negotiate with him. A lesser warrior couldn&#x2019;t. Not according to Naa traditions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was given access to some relevant intelligence reports,&#x201d; Jivani said. &#x201c;The villagers who lived in Doothdown gave you the name Nofear Deathgiver. And it&#x2019;s safe to assume that Truthsayer has heard of you by now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Precisely,&#x201d; Cavenaugh said. &#x201c;So, here are your orders. You will take a mixed force of legionnaires and Naa south, find the chief of chiefs, and give him some gifts. Then you will invite the son of a bitch to come up and negotiate with us.&#x201d;</p><p>McKee knew the mission was next to impossible. In order to carry out Cavenaugh&#x2019;s orders, she&#x2019;d have to enter territory that no legionnaire had visited before&#x2014;and try to find a Naa who hated slick skins in general and her in particular. A suicide mission for sure. But she couldn&#x2019;t say that. No legionnaire could. So McKee gave voice to the obvious question. &#x201c;And if Truthsayer says, &#x2018;No&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>Cavenaugh had bushy eyebrows. They rose slightly. &#x201c;In that case, it will be your duty to shoot him.&#x201d;</p><p>McKee wanted to laugh or cry. She wasn&#x2019;t sure which. If she caught up with Truthsayer, and that was a huge <i>if</i>, the Naa leader would be surrounded by bodyguards. And were she to so much as lift a finger against Truthsayer, she&#x2019;d be dead within seconds. A possibility that didn&#x2019;t seem to trouble Cavenaugh at all.</p><p>Then McKee realized that the government would score a propaganda coup either way. If she brought Truthsayer to the negotiating table, then so much the better. That&#x2019;s the sort of thing heroes were supposed to do. And if she gave her life in an attempt to kill him, that would suit their purposes equally well. She could imagine the headline. &#x201c;War hero dies in a valiant attempt to kill rebel leader.&#x201d; With any luck, Andy would have time to upload video of the assassination attempt just before the machine was beaten to death. &#x201c;I see, sir,&#x201d; McKee said. &#x201c;I like the first option better.&#x201d;</p><p>Both men chuckled, but Jivani frowned. &#x201c;With all due respect, Colonel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That&#x2019;s a bad idea. If the lieutenant assassinates Truthsayer, that could start a war and make negotiations impossible.&#x201d;</p><p>Cavenaugh frowned. &#x201c;We <i>are</i> at war because Truthsayer decided to bring all of the southern tribes together under his totem.

At the core of the book is what the author calls "the state of presence," a living in the "now" that is both intensely inspirational and practical. When the pressures of future and past thinking disappear, fear and frustration also vanish, conquered by the moment. Stillness Speaks takes the form of 200 individual entries, organized into 10 topic clusters that range from "Beyond the Thinking Mind" to "Suffering and the End of Suffering." Each entry is concise and complete in itself, but, read together, take on a transformative power.</p><p>Expanding on his mantra&#x2014;<i>Get out of your head and into the moment</i>&#x2014;Eckhart Tolle offers this new book on living in the now. Here Tolle emphasizes the art of "inner stillness"--the place where thoughts, ego and attachments fall always and we are left only with what the moment has to offer: "When you lose touch with inner stillness, you lose touch with yourself. When you lose touch with yourself, you lose yourself in the world." Don't expect this to be a quick skim or even a straight-through read. Like his previous bestselling book <i>The Power of Now</i>, Tolle uses brief entries and numerous white spaces to give readers easy in-and-out access into enticing spiritual insights that expound on inner stillness, such as learning the difference between surrender and resignation, overcoming the fear death, and how to end suffering. In fact, this is designed to be an ongoing conversation. Pick it up any time or any place, but be sure to allow for plenty of breaks for serious contemplation. Even as you occasionally abandon the book, don't abandon the teachings, pleads Tolle. Embracing and practicing inner stillness is no longer a luxury, he writes, "but a necessity if humankind is not to destroy itself. At the present time the dysfunction of the old consciousness and the arising of the new are both accelerating. Paradoxically things are getting worse and bett! er at the same time, although 'the worse' is more apparent because it makes so much noise." Devotees who have read all of Tolle's books and audio tapes probably won't find new ideas or information here. But they may appreciate the refresher course --revisiting familiar concepts in a slightly different package. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Eckhart Tolle was born in Germany, where he spent the first thirteen years of his life. After graduating from the University of London, he was a research scholar and supervisor at Cambridge University. When he was twenty-nine, a profound spiritual transformation virtually dissolved his old identity and radically changed the course of his life. The next few years were devoted to understanding, integrating, and deepening that transformation, which marked the beginning of an intense inward journey. Eckhart is not aligned with any particular religion or tradition. In his teaching, he conveys a simple yet profound message with the timeless and uncomplicated clarity of the ancient spiritual masters: there is a way out of suffering and into peace. Eckhart is currently traveling extensively, taking his teachings and his presence throughout the world. He has lived in Vancouver, Canada, since 1996.</p><h2>A Tale of Two Funerals: The Throw Rug and the Tapestry</h2><p>Meet the Williams family.

Permeated by an unforgettable smell, Back of the Yards was a melting pot of immigrants, many who worked in the stockyards. In 1894, Mary McDowell started the University of Chicago Settlement House in Back of the Yards. She improved living conditions and in 1905 helped create Davis Square Park. The Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council was founded in 1939 by Joseph Meegan, Saul Alinsky, and Bishop Bernard Sheil and is America&#x2019;s oldest notforprofit communitybased organization. It consisted of 185 delegate organizations involving residents, business owners, churches, parks, schools, and social clubs that worked to advocate improvements.

Brian Karas comes a witty tale about navigating family and finding one's voice-based on Greek mythology!<br><br>This is the story of how young Zeus, with a little help from six monsters, five Greek gods, an enchanted she-goat, and his mother, became god of gods, master of lightning and thunder, and ruler over all. in doing so, he learned a lot about family. Who knew that having relatives could be so complicated, even for a god?</p><p>G. Brian Karas is the prolific and versatile illustrator and writer of many children&#39;s books including Atlantic and Saving Sweetness by Diane Stanley, both ALA Notable Books and Home on the Bayou, a Boston Globe/Horn Book Honor title. The New York Times describes his work as &#34;...depicted in a childlike style that belies the sophistication of the drawings. Exquisite and moving in its subtlety.&#34; He lives in the Hudson Valley of New York with his family. Visit him a gbriankaras.com.With action-packed artwork and goofy humor, Karas imagines Zeus as a young boy and then an awkward teen, all before he reigned over Mount Olympus. Raised on isolated Crete by a magical she-goat, Zeus longs for playmates. Then he learns the truth about his family: his father, Cronus, ate his siblings; only Zeus was spared by living in secret exile. Determined to rescue his family, he leaves his safe island, finds his father, and delivers a magic potion, which induces a mighty belch that expels his long-lost brothers and sisters (&#x201c;looking surprisingly good&#x201d;) from Cronus&#x2019; belly. Together, the siblings fling their father into the sea, but their troubles are far from over. Karas continues Zeus&#x2019; danger-defying journey, from the underworld to Earth and finally to Mount Olympus, where he takes the throne. The irreverent words (&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go get &#x2019;em!&#x201d;), occasional songs, vibrant mixed-media art, and constant action make this a great choice for group sharing, and kids will see their own family members among the cast of Karas&#x2019; humanlike gods, especially the bickering siblings and furious, lonely young Zeus.

Living in relative obscurity in Northern Galilee, Luria experienced a powerful epiphany that influenced his lyrical, influential text. Poetically and meditatively described, the range of subjects includes the revelation of the Godhead's light in the world and its relationship to every aspect of the human life cycle, including lovemaking, conception, gestation, birth, and maturation.</p><p>Eliahu Klein has taught Kabbalah and Hassidism for over twenty-five years throughout North America, England, and Israel. He apprenticed under some of the greatest Jewish spiritual teachers of this generation, including Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, and Rabbi Shlomo Twerski of Denver. Rabbi Klein received a private <i>simchah</i> (rabbinic ordination) from the late Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan in 1983, and in 1995 he published <i>Meetings with Remarkable Souls: Legends of the Baal Shem Tov </i>(Jason Aronson). In 2001 he was a visiting scholar at the Oxford Center for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, an affiliate institute of Oxford University in England. Rabbi Klein has taught at San Francisco State University and The Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, and is currently on the faculty of Chochmat Halev Jewish Meditation Center in Berkeley, California, and the Academy of Jewish Religions in Los Angeles. Along with writing meditative commentaries on the Bible, the Haggadah, and the Jewish prayerbook, he is completing a degree in Clinical Pastoral Education at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center. Rabbi Klein lives with his family in Berkeley, California."Eliahu Klein's translations of the Lurianic canon are faithful and yet poetic. His understanding of Isaac Luria's relationship to World Spirituality has an integrity that few have attained. Klein's writing provides the English reader with a rare window into the Kabbalah as it really is."<br>-Pinchas Giller, Professor of Jewish Thought, Unviversity of Judaism<br><br>"<i>Kabbalah of Creation</i> offers readers a readable, verse translation of the intriguing text, 'The Gate of Principles,' that is printed in the beginning of the Hebrew edition of Rabbi Chaim Vital's <i>The Tree of Life</i>. However, this book is much more than a translation. <i>Kabbalah of Creation</i> considerably increases the accessibility of the text with a very useful commentary that explains many otherwise obscure references. With the addition of an informative introduction, containing much useful historical information, a glossary, and an extensive bibliography, Rabbi Klein's work can easily serve as an introductory text for those seeking to enter the gates of Lurianic Kabbalah. Even experienced kabbalists may find something to learn from Rabbi Klein's sometimes daring insights&#x2014;the fruit of decades of study, meditation, and spiritual experience."<br>-Rabbi Miles Krassen, Naropa University<br><br>"Eliahu Klein helps us move toward the Real. Unlike many translations of Luria's work, <i>Kabbalah of Creation</i>(Klein's rendition of some of the never-before-translated early work of Reb Luria) is filled not only with Luria's words (as they have come through his disciples&#x2014;we have nothing of Luria's own writing) but with Klein's, whose commentary makes abundantly clear to us that even while he is ensconced in traditional Judaism, he understands the large implications of Luria's work. His style is human, forgiving, supportive, challenging, and often deeply insightful, everything a guide should be. We could not ask for a better door opener than Luria and his new translator, Eliahu Klein."<br>-Jason Shulman, <i>Tikkun Magazine</i></p><h2>46 Days: Keeping Up With Jennifer Pharr Davis on the Appalachian Trail</h2><p>46 Days chronicles the trials, successes, joys, and frustrations of Jennifer Pharr Davis&#39;s record-winning Appalachian Trail thru-hike through the eyes of her husband, Brew Davis.

In fact, his translations of Edgar Allan Poe's works are considered classics of French prose. Throughout much of his life, however, Baudelaire was dismissed as a vulgar drug addict preoccupied with sex and death. Prosecuted for obscenity and reeling from one financial disaster to another, he produced a number of literary works that went unrecognized during his lifetime. Perhaps the most significant collection of poetry published in Europe during the nineteenth century, his <i>Flowers of Evil</i> was critically condemned, and the remaining years of his life were marked by a sense of failure, disillusionment, and despair.<br>This volume of the poet's essays and drawings &#x2014; collected and published after his death &#x2014; includes cryptic memoranda, literary notes, quotations, rough drafts of prose poems, and personal tirades. More than anything else, they reveal the spiritual underpinnings of his work, transcending the squalor of financial ruin and the torture of physical decline to offer compelling thoughts on his world, society, and philosophy.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Peyote Religion: A History (Volume 181) (The Civilization of the American Indian Series)</h2><p><p>In this definitive work-a product of more than half a century of research and close observation-the noted anthropologist Omer C. Stewart provides a sweeping reconstruction of the rise of peyotism and the Native American Church. Although it is commonly known that the modern peyote religion became formalized around 1880 in western Oklahoma, it had roots in precontact American Indian ritual. Today it is practiced by thousands upon thousands of American Indians throughout the West.</p><p>Long a subject of controversy, peyotism has become a unifying influence in Indian life, providing the basis for ceremonies, friendships, social gatherings, travel, marriage, and much more. As Stewart demonstrates, it has been a source of comfort and healing and a means of expression for a troubled people.</p><p></p></p><p><p><strong>Omer C. Stewart </strong>received the Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, as a student of A. L. Kroeber, Robert H. Lowie, and Carl Sauer. No non-Indian knew the Native American Church and its history better than he.</p>The Native American Church is the most rapidly growing religious movement on Western Indian reservations. Because the consumption of peyote, a hallucinogenic cactus, is central, the religion has been controversial since its start as an organized faith in the 1800s. Stewart chronicles the church's history from its early roots in Mexico through official recognition in the 20th century. He discusses the church's leaders, its role in Indian unification, and its importance as a response to the pressures of white America. This work complements the scientific discussion by Edward F. Anderson in Peyote ( LJ 3/15/80). Recommended for academic libraries. Mary B.

Told for the wrong reasons, it can be as painful for the listener as for the teller. However, as we know from literature and media, Sophie's Choice to The Sixth Sense, told properly, a difficult story can powerfully alter not only he who tells it, but those who hear it. <br><br>How can we tell the stories of wickedness and loss, sorrow and grief? How do we respectfully engage our audience and get to the core of a story's meaning? Niemi and Ellis begin with the assumption that it is essential and beneficial to tell difficult stories. Stopping our ears or stilling our tongues will not make tragedy go away; rather, the first step in ending suffering is to name it for what it is.</p><p><strong>N/A</strong></p><h2>Wanted (Most Wanted)</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER �&nbsp;For fans of<i> Release Me</i> comes a series of three enigmatic and powerful men, and the striking women who can bring them to their knees.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <i><b>He is everything I crave, all I desperately want&#x2014;and he is everything I can&#x2019;t have.</b></i><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Evan Black embodies my every fantasy.

Politicians mingled with financiers mingled with artists and academics, and everyone was smiling and laughing and toasting the deceased.<br><br>At his request, there&#x2019;d been no formal funeral. Just this gathering of friends and family, food and drink, music and mirth. Jahn&#x2014;�he hated the name Howard&#x2014;�had lived a vibrant life, and that was never more obvious than now in his death.<br><br>I missed him so damn much, but I hadn&#x2019;t cried. Hadn&#x2019;t screamed and ranted. Hadn&#x2019;t done anything, really, except move through the days and nights lost in a haze of emotions, my mind numb. My body anesthetized.<br><br>I sighed and fingered the charm on my silver bracelet. He&#x2019;d presented me with the tiny motorcycle just over a month ago, and the gift had made me smile. I hadn&#x2019;t talked about wanting to ride a motorcycle since before I turned sixteen. And it had been years since I&#x2019;d ridden behind a boy, my arms tight around his waist and my hair blowing in the wind.<br><br>But Uncle Jahn knew me better than anyone. He saw past the princess to the girl hidden inside. A girl who&#x2019;d built up walls out of necessity, but still desperately wanted to break free.

He should be beside me, dammit, and the swell of laughter and conversation that filled the room was making me a little sick.<br><br>Despite the fact that I knew Jahn wanted it that way, it was all I could do not to smack all the people who&#x2019;d hugged me and murmured softly that he was in a better place and wasn&#x2019;t it wonderful that he&#x2019;d lived such a full life. That was such bullshit&#x2014;�he hadn&#x2019;t even turned sixty yet.

There was a bar set up on the other side of the room, and I&#x2019;d positioned myself as far away as physically possible because right then I wanted the burn of tequila. Wanted to let go, to explode through the numbness that clung to me like a cocoon. To run. To feel.<br><br>But that wasn&#x2019;t going to happen. No alcohol was passing these lips tonight. I was Jahn&#x2019;s niece, after all, and that made me some kind of hostess-�by-�default, which meant I was stuck in the penthouse. Four thousand square feet, but I swear I could feel the art-�covered walls pressing in around me.<br><br>I wanted to race up the spiral staircase to the rooftop patio, then leap over the balcony into the darkening sky. I wanted to take flight over Lake Michigan and the whole world. I wanted to break things and scream and rant and curse this damned universe that took away a good man.<br><br>Shit. I sucked in a breath and looked down at the exquisite ancient-�looking notebook inside the glass and chrome display case I&#x2019;d been leaning against. The leather-�bound book was an exceptionally well-�done copy of a recently discovered Da Vinci notebook. Dubbed the Creature Notebook, it had sixteen pages of animal studies and was open to the center, revealing a stunning sketch the young master had drawn&#x2014;�his study for the famous, but never located, dragon shield. Jahn had attempted to acquire the notebook, and I remember just how angry he&#x2019;d been when he&#x2019;d lost out to Victor Neely, another Chicago businessman with a private collection that rivaled my uncle&#x2019;s.<br><br>At the time, I&#x2019;d just started at Northwestern with a major in poli sci and a minor in art history. I&#x2019;m not particularly talented, but I&#x2019;ve sketched my whole life, and I&#x2019;ve been fascinated with art&#x2014;�and in particular with Leonardo da Vinci&#x2014;�since my parents took me to my first museum at the age of three.<br><br>I thought the Creature Notebook was beyond cool, and I&#x2019;d been irritated on Jahn&#x2019;s behalf when he not only lost out on it, but when the press had poured salt in the wound by prattling on about Neely&#x2019;s amazing new acquisition.<br><br>About a year later, Jahn showed me the facsimile, bright and shiny in the custom-�made display case. As a general rule, my uncle never owned a copy. If he couldn&#x2019;t have the original&#x2014;�be it a Rembrandt or a Rauschenberg or a Da Vinci&#x2014;�he simply moved on. When I&#x2019;d asked why he&#x2019;d made an exception for the Creature Notebook, he shrugged and told me that the images were at least as interesting as the provenance. &#x201c;Besides, anyone who can successfully copy a Da Vinci has created a masterpiece himself.&#x201d;<br><br>Despite the fact that it wasn&#x2019;t authentic, the notebook was my favorite of Jahn&#x2019;s many manuscripts and artifacts, and now, standing with my hands pressed to the glass, I felt as if he was, in some small way, beside me.<br><br>I drew in a breath, knowing I had to get my act together, if for no other reason than the more wrecked I looked, the more guests would try to cheer me. Not that I looked particularly wrecked. When you grow up as Angelina Hayden Raine, with a United States senator for a father and a mother who served on the board of over a dozen international nonprofit organizations, you learn the difference between a public and a private face very early on. Especially when you have your own secrets to keep.<br><br>&#x201c;This is so goddamn fucked up it makes me want to scream.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt a whisper of a smile touch my lips and turned around to find myself looking into Kat&#x2019;s bloodshot eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, hell, Angie,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He shouldn&#x2019;t be dead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d be pissed if he knew you&#x2019;d been crying,&#x201d; I said, blinking away the last of my own tears.<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck that.&#x201d;<br><br>I almost laughed. Katrina Laron had a talent for cutting straight through the bullshit.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not sure which one of us leaned in first, but we caught each other in a bone-�crushing hug. With a sniffle, I finally pulled away. Perverse, maybe, but just knowing that someone else was acknowledging the utter horror of the situation made me feel infinitesimally better.<br><br>&#x201c;Every time I turn a corner, I feel like I&#x2019;m going to see him,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I almost wish I&#x2019;d stayed in my old place.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;d moved in four months ago when Uncle Jahn&#x2019;s aneurysm was discovered. I&#x2019;d taken time off from work&#x2014;�easy when you work for your uncle. For two weeks I&#x2019;d played nurse after he came home from the hospital, and when he&#x2019;d been given the all-�clear by the doctors&#x2014;�yeah, like that was a good call&#x2014;�I&#x2019;d accepted his invitation to move in permanently. Why not? The tiny apartment I&#x2019;d shared with my lifelong friend Flynn wasn&#x2019;t exactly the lap of luxury. And although I loved Flynn, he wasn&#x2019;t the easiest person to cohabitate with. He knew me too well, and it always made me uneasy when people saw what I wanted to keep hidden.<br><br>Now, though, I craved both the cocoon-�like comfort of my tiny room and Flynn&#x2019;s steady presence. As much as I loved the condo, without my uncle, it was cold and hollow, and just being in it made me feel brittle. As if at any moment I would shatter into a million pieces.<br><br>Kat&#x2019;s eyes were warm and understanding. &#x201c;I know. But he loved having you here. God knows why,&#x201d; she added with a quirky grin. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re nothing but trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>I rolled my eyes. At twenty-�seven, Katrina Laron was only four years older than me, but that didn&#x2019;t stop her from pulling the older-�and-�wiser card whenever she got the chance. The fact that we&#x2019;d become friends under decidedly dodgy circumstances probably played a role, too.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been working at one of the coffee shops in Evanston where I used to mainline caffeine during my first year at Northwestern. We&#x2019;d chatted a couple of times in an &#x201c;extra cream please, it&#x2019;s been a bitch of a day&#x201d; kind of way, but we were hardly on a first-name basis.<br><br>All that changed when we bumped into each other on a day when extra cream wasn&#x2019;t going to cut it for me&#x2014;�not by a long shot. It was in the Michigan Avenue Neiman Marcus and I&#x2019;d been surfing on adrenaline, using it to soothe the rough edges of a particularly crappy day. Specifically, I&#x2019;d just succumbed to my personal demons and surreptitiously dropped a pair of fifteen-�dollar clearance earrings into my purse. But, apparently, not as surreptitiously as I&#x2019;d thought.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, aren&#x2019;t you the stumbling amateur?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d whispered, as she steered me toward women&#x2019;s shoes. &#x201c;With a shit technique like that, it&#x2019;s a wonder you haven&#x2019;t been arrested yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Arrested!&#x201d; I squeaked, as if that word would carry all the way to Washington and to my father&#x2019;s all-�hearing ears. The fear of getting caught might be part of the excitement. Actually getting caught wasn&#x2019;t a good thing at all. &#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;�I mean&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>She cut off my protests with a casual flip of her hand. &#x201c;All I&#x2019;m saying is be smart. If you&#x2019;re going to take a risk, at least make it worth the trouble. Those earrings? Really not the bomb.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about the earrings,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d snapped, then immediately cringed. The words had been a knee-�jerk response, but they were also true. It wasn&#x2019;t about the earrings. It was about my dad, and the grad school lectures and the career-planning talks, and the never-spoken certainty that no matter what I did, my sister would have done it better.<br><br>It was about the oppressive, overwhelming weight of my life and my future that was bearing down on me, harder and harder until I was certain that if I didn&#x2019;t do something to break out a little I&#x2019;d spontaneously combust.<br><br>Kat had glanced at my purse as if she could see through the soft Coach leather to the contraband inside. Then she slowly lifted her eyes back to my face. The silence hung between us for a full minute. Then she nodded. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I get it.&#x201d; She cocked her head toward the exit. &#x201c;Come on.&#x201d;<br><br>Relief flooded through me, and my limbs that had frozen in both fear and mortification began to thaw. She steered me to her car, a cherry-�red Mustang that she drove at more or less the speed of light. She careened down Michigan Avenue, maneuvered her way onto Lake Shore Drive, and came so close to the other cars as she zipped in and out of traffic that I&#x2019;m surprised her convertible didn&#x2019;t lose a layer of paint. In other words, it was freaking awesome. The top was down, the wind was whipping my hair into my face and mouth, and all I could do was tilt my head back and laugh.<br><br>Kat risked our lives long enough to shoot me one sideways glance. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to get along just fine.&#x201d;<br><br>From that moment on, I&#x2019;d adored Kat. Now, with Jahn&#x2019;s death sending my universe reeling, I realized that I not only loved her&#x2014;�I relied on her.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really glad you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Where else would I be?&#x201d; She scanned the room. &#x201c;Are your mom and dad around somewhere?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They can&#x2019;t make it. They&#x2019;re stuck overseas.&#x201d; The familiar numbness settled over me again as I remembered my mother&#x2019;s hysterical sobs and the deep well of sorrow that had filled my father&#x2019;s voice when he&#x2019;d learned about his half-�brother. &#x201c;I hated calling them,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;It felt like Gracie all over again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201d; Kat had never met my sister, but she&#x2019;d heard the story. The public version, anyway, and I knew her sympathy was real.<br><br>I managed a wavering smile. &#x201c;I know. That means a lot to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The whole thing sucks,&#x201d; Kat said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so unfair. Your uncle was too damn cool to die.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess the universe doesn&#x2019;t give a shit about coolness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The universe can be a raving bitch sometimes,&#x201d; Kat said. She exhaled loudly. &#x201c;Want me to crash here tonight so you won&#x2019;t be alone? We could stay up late getting so wasted that there&#x2019;s no way in hell either one of us will dream.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, but I think I&#x2019;ll be okay.&#x201d;<br><br>She eyed me uncertainly. She was one of the few people I&#x2019;d confided in about my nightmares, and while I appreciated the sympathy, sometimes I wished I&#x2019;d kept my mouth shut.<br><br>&#x201c;Really,&#x201d; I said earnestly. &#x201c;Kevin&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah? And how&#x2019;s that going? Engaged yet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not quite,&#x201d; I said wryly. I supposed we were dating since I&#x2019;d slept with him twice, but so far I&#x2019;d dodged the let&#x2019;s-�be-�exclusive conversation. I wasn&#x2019;t sure why I was so reticent. The sex wasn&#x2019;t mind-�blowing, but it did the job. And I did genuinely like the guy. But I&#x2019;d spent the last few months holding him at arm&#x2019;s length, telling him I needed to keep my attention on Jahn&#x2019;s surgery, then his recovery.<br><br>Obviously, I hadn&#x2019;t planned on his sudden death.<br><br>How horrible was it of me to think that now Jahn was gone, I had no more excuses to hand Kevin?<br><br>Beside me, Kat craned her neck and scoped out the crowd. &#x201c;So where is he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He had to go take a call. Technically, he&#x2019;s working today.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you going to do now?&#x201d; Kat asked.<br><br>&#x201c;About Kevin?&#x201d; Honestly, I was hoping to avoid doing anything on that front for the foreseeable future.<br><br>&#x201c;About your job,&#x201d; she countered. &#x201c;About the roof over your head. About your life. Have you thought about what you&#x2019;re going to do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; My shoulders sagged. &#x201c;No. Not really.&#x201d; My job in the PR department of Jahn&#x2019;s company might pay my bills, but it was hardly my life&#x2019;s ambition, and Kat was one of the few people to whom I&#x2019;d confessed that deep, dark secret. Right then, however, that wasn&#x2019;t a conversation I wanted to have. Fortunately, something across the room had caught Kat&#x2019;s attention, effectively erasing my lack of direction and purpose from her mind.<br><br>She stood slightly straighter and the corners of her mouth tilted a bit, almost hinting at a smile. Curious, I turned to look in that direction, but saw nothing but suits and dresses and a sea of black. &#x201c;What is it? Kevin?&#x201d; I asked, praying he wasn&#x2019;t heading our direction.<br><br>&#x201c;Cole August,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;At least I thought I saw him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I licked my lips. My mouth had gone suddenly dry. &#x201c;Is Evan with him?&#x201d; I forced my voice to sound casual, but my pulse was racing. If Cole was around, it was always a good bet that Evan was, too.<br><br>Then I remembered what day it was and my pulse slowed as disappointment weighed down on me. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t tonight the ribbon-�cutting for the hospital wing Evan funded?&#x201d;<br><br>Kat didn&#x2019;t even spare me a glance, her eyes still searching the crowd. &#x201c;Not sure.&#x201d; She shot me a quick look. &#x201c;Yeah, it was. You invited me before, you know, all of this happened.&#x201d;<br><br>I blinked back the sudden prick of tears. &#x201c;Evan&#x2019;s going to hate missing this. Jahn was like a dad to him.&#x201d;<br><br>Beside me, Kat took a quick step backward, startling me.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>She dragged her gaze away from the crowd, then frowned at me. &#x201c;I . . . Oh, shit. I have to go make a call. I&#x2019;ll be right back, okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Um, okay.&#x201d; Who the hell did she need to ...</p>
